No visible can dating, or smudged.Absolutley blooming and frothy large but controlled bleach white head. Excellent staying power, like a bold IPA, and a gleaming bright white appearance. Light touches of soapy lacing, while sitting on a shiny opaque but not hazy lemon yellow that's in the goldilocks range, not too dark or light .. Just looking right.. Very great looking brew.The aroma is gang busters. A giant whiff of tropical fruit, soft acidity and a rush that makes your head go places. Giant amounts of passion fruit, hints even key lime and a touch of pie crust sugar crumble. Tropical guava, mango, you name it… you can get lost here. Touches even creamy notes of vanilla strangely in the mix. I am afraid to even drink this because I am convinced this can't be topped and it wont be better at this point… har har..The palate is still quite enjoyable, but seems only a slight let down from the nose, which is understandable. A very ight body, supportive enough, but missing a bit of edge to push this wild into exceptional territory. Still the palate hits solidly with good tropical guava, passion fruit, and mango flavors. Real light bodied and comes off more mimosa and slightly flat champagne in feel, but gives excellent fruit character to the palate. Doesn't quite hint of souring, strangely, as it seems to have really mellowed out in acidity and funk, but in a nice way.I am pretty certain that this is quite a few months old in the can, but seeing that this is so highly rated there was no way I could pass it up for trying. It holds up real impressively, I'd be curious if some of the dry hopping would be more evident for a fresher beer to try. Definitely want to be having this again in the future, and that bouquet is just exquisite!!Aug 16, 2020"", ""16 oz / 473 mL can dated 8/8/19 on the bottom (so presumably a little over 6 months old) poured into a narrow stemmed beer (for my purposes) glass.Pale straw-yellow coloring (a previous reviewer mentioned pineapple juice, which is spot-on from a color perspective) with medium haze and full opaqueness but zero turbidity. A minute stream of carbonation cascades up the sides of the glass, feeding a (initially) big, fluffy, soapy, off-white head of multi-sized bubbles. That head drops to a bubbly film quite quickly, with odd spots of lacing down the glass. Quite pretty for a wild ale, and the hazy glow adds to the attractiveness.Delicate but really lovely nose, with both sweet and sour/tart notes: lemon, nectarine, passionfruit, wine grapes, granny smith apple, under-ripe pineapple, damp green grass, juicy orange, peach, pear, and a slight horsey funk. Quite floral, thinking honeysuckle and rose pedals, with a little peppery spice. Really, really wonderful with its nuance, layers, and complimentary components. Absolutely digging the aroma profile, which remains true to the wild/sour category while introducing some nice (but not overpowering) IPA characteristics.Heavy wine and cider influence on the tongue, with a very nice balance of tartness and fruity sweentess, plus a little Brett-like bite. Grapefruit pith, lime zest, under-ripe pineapple and peach, nectarine skin, passionfruit, dry Chardonnay, starchy greens, and yeast roll. Slightly puckering and prickly on the tongue, but finishes extremely dry and clean with a lingering note of sour green apple and lemon. It both is and isn't sour, which is quite interesting. There's also a note of salinity in the background. I'm not loving the taste profile quite as much as the remarkable aroma profile, but it's still very tasty and extremely drinkable.Light but soft feel, nicely carbonated with a wonderful prickle, plus a nice coating aspect on the teeth and throat. There's residual citrus and pith on the teeth that provides a nice juicy kick in the aftermath.This one comes with some pretty high marks by BA reviewers, but it largely lives up to the billing. Really outstanding beer that I would absolutely seek out again.Feb 26, 2020"", 'Hazy pineapple juice with no visible carbonation and 4 fingers of glassy white head.Smells of nectarines and fresh green herbs, pineapple and candy.Bone dry sour of passionfruit, pineapple and dank green herb.Light body with champagne carbonation. Dry finish.I got this in Banff, AB, and am drinking in Redding, CA, Dec 4th, 2019Dec 04, 2019', ""Hazy pale gold color. Pours very little head which left no lacing.Scent of mixed fruit with some tart and slightly funky overtones. Swirling the glass kicked up a bit of barnyard.Tart fruit flavor with some light yeast and mild bitters. The aftertaste is bitter sour, more like a light grapefruit than hops. A bit of barnyard kicks in at the end.Low carbonation level, so it doesn't foam up much. Somewhat astringent.My notes on this beer from a year ago make no mention of the barnyard smell and flavor. It is fairly low level, but I have been hypersensitized by all the local beer that tastes of nothing but barnyard this year. I would be much happier if the barnyard was knocked down by an order of magnitude. This has lost more than a full point in the score from last year. The sooner the barnyard plague in the region is over, the better.Aug 31, 2019"", 'On tap in BC at 5.5% ABV. Pours slightly hazy, pale golden with a fine white head. Mild cooked nectarine and bread in the nose. Excellent, nectarine heavy flavor. Lightly carbonated body is a bit too thin.Jul 10, 2019', 'Purchased at Unwined liquor store at the Edmonton City Centre.650ml bottle poured into tulip.Pours a slightly hazy lemon yellow with two plump fingers of head the colour of clean bedsheets that leaves more of that cool Four Winds Grecian urn lace as it recedes.Smells of juicy sliced peaches and nectarines, mango, pineapple chunks, sour green grapes, passionfruit juice, lemon juice, white bread, softly peppery yeast, mild cheesy funk and some gentle green hops.Tastes of lemon zest, peach and nectarine flesh, more tropical fruit like mango and pineapple, bready pale malt, soft white cheese, dusted pepper and more leafy, citrusy hops.Feels light and airy. Light bodied with creamy carbonation. FInishes off-dry.Verdict: Vigorusly recommended. This stuff is fantastic, tart and fruity and juicy. Drink immediately.Jun 14, 2019', 'Hazy dark blonde; lots of tangerine + peach; bright white vinegar, white peaches, slight dank, and some orange underneath. 4 4.25 4.25 4 4.25Bright - not getting any sourness off the nose. And sure enough, there are a ton of delicate, yummy orchard fruit notes on the palate. I can’t say, though, that any of them are hops. I definitely shouldn’t have let this sit for almost a year. Nectar, all right, but I want it fresh.May 07, 2019', ""It's not often I get a growler at a non-brewery and they hold up this well. Aromas/flavours of granadilla, passionfruit, peach. Semi-dry. Incredibly tight. Top 3 beers of 2017.Jun 21, 2017"", 'Aromas of acidic fruit, hops blending very well with the acidic notes. Light on the palate with both elements coming together again. Grapefruit like acidity with notes of lemon. A lovely balance to this dry hopped sour that comes very close to Jelly King quality. Great stuff.May 31, 2017', 'Poured from fridge temp. Pours a light yellow color with good transparency. Good carbonation. Smell is a mix of hops and sour funk. Quite amazing. Lots of citrus peel. Lots of lemon. Taste is amazing. Lots of lemon, sour, and funk. Mouthfeel is great. This is an outstanding beer.Apr 01, 2017', ""One of the barrel versions, dated October 2015, 750ml caged and corked. Nice hazy straw colour with a golden hue. Nice tart citrus rind on the nose with hints of barnyard funk and a sweet fruity finish. Flavors are insane, loads of fruity peaches, so much so TN at I had to check the ingredients list to see if they had added them to the brew. Fruity hop flavors are nicely complemented by a nicely balanced tart finish. Goes down smooth and finishes with a touch of dryness. This stuff is unreal, though I understand they've changed their brewing process a bit and the newer versions aren't quite up to snuff with the earlier versions. Definitely glad I had the opportunity to try one of the original brews, absolutely fantastic.Oct 10, 2016"", 'Appearance: Hazy lemon drop gold with a pale pastel straw coloured head of medium and largish bubbles. Despite dissipating rather quickly, it does leave a decent surface and lacing ring with a few chunky surface deposits.Aromatics: Some glorious tropical sour funk. With stone and tropical fruits - peach, pineapple, mango, guava, and passionfruit… almost smells like a Guava Punch Rockstar energy drink. Plenty of sweet nectars (nectarine and apricot) and sugars filling out the orchestra in the background.Taste: Ooowee zinger sour kick right off the bat. The tropical fruitiness really showing through with a slightly subdued lemon zing and vibrant pineapple and stone fruits filling out the entry form and jamming it in the raffle box. There is a very odd complexity in the flavour mix, the sour doing a wonderful job of keeping the tastebuds in a frenzy as the sweet flavours wash over the palate.Feel: Tart, zesty and bright with a medium body and enough carbonation to keep things upbeat and festive. Superb clean finish.Overall: One of the best sours I’ve had. It’s aromatic notes really doing justice to the flavour and the mouthfeel.Pairing : A wonderful sour that I think could use further supports as opposed to trying to counter. For me its Greek all the way on this one. Start with a fresh tzatziki sauce and pita bread dippers, followed by a main course of Lemon Dill Grilled Salmon and/or Souvlaki Beef Kabobs and greek-style roast potatoes on the side.Sep 24, 2016', 'The orange glow of the beer in the tulip is near radioactive. The head, initially furious but fleeting. Perfect sourness. Prominent citrus and peach flavours. Give a decent pucker. Quite tart. Hops are present but not overbearing. Very refreshing. Great summer beer!Jul 05, 2016', 'Golden. Slight haze. Billowing white head. Musty grape aroma. Lemon zest front of the mouth. Almost furniture polish intensity. Puckeringly sour with marigold like flower notes. Prickly carbonation. Finiishes with grapefruit rind dry hop astringencyJun 21, 2016', '650 mL bottle acquired from a generous trader during the last CANBIF. Served slightly chilled.Pours a cloudy golden-blonde colour, with one finger of dense, creamy, highly resilient white head seated atop; it retains cohesion for a period of time exceeding fifteen minutes. Excellent lacing, with a thick, lumpy, foamy cap and collar. Juicy notes of fuzzy peach, mango, passion fruit, white grape, papaya, bubble gum and mandarin orange make themselves well-known on the nose. Lighter notes of funky acidity and grainy, bready pale malt sweetness. Very enticing aroma; certainly one of the most tempting that I can recall. Totally delicious; fruity, sour, tart and tangy. Subtle, grainy pale malt sweetness is immediately obliterated by flavours of sour peach, juicy nectarine, mango, passion fruit and tangerine. Orange rind, lemon zest and lingering tropical fruit flavours remain prominent through the finish, distracting from sour notes that give the aftertaste a tart feel. Very little funk to speak of; it\'s mostly just tropical/orchard fruit and sharp acidity - but oh man, is that a fabulous combo. The lemony tartness and lactic acid intensify after the second pour, concentrating the ""wildness"" of this beer, if you will. Light in body, with middling carbonation levels that provide the palate with a gentle jolt of prickly bubbles. Not particularly crisp, which is what I was expecting - the mouthfeel has a softer, frothier feel to it, but it\'s still extremely refreshing nonetheless.Final Grade: 4.63, a near-flawless A+. Nectarous is hands-down one of the best soured ales that I\'ve had the good fortune to try, at least to date. Thanks again, Farees! This one\'s flavour abounds with notes of juicy, tart stone fruit and tropical fruit, which act as an exceedingly effective counterpoint to the wild bug acidity that wraps the profile up cleanly. A truly outstanding wild ale that deserves to be on Canada\'s Top 20 list - seek this one out (and then drink it!) with enthusiasm.May 28, 2016', 'Got on trade! 650ml bottle served at 7deg C in a tulipA- Open well and pours a 1"" high white head that films out within 2mins or so. Medium gold colour and unfiltered.S- Sour! T- Sour! LOL Nice sour base. Has some hops but overshadowed but the sourness of the brew.

Enjoyable but strong sour notes just overwhelm. Would buy again.Food PairingThis sour would go very well with....... Rhubarb pie!

Peach and apricot. Nice stone fruit hoppiness. Actually tastes like stone fruit up front, but the hop flavor becomes more apparent later. Light body. Crisp. Very nice.Jan 11, 2016', 'Amazing stuff here. Hazy orange pour, good sized pillowy head that left lots of lace. Aroma and taste of passionfruit, juicy young peach, apricot, nectarine, citrus rinds. Juicy mouthfeel. Slightly tangy and fairly sour but still very approachable! I want more - several more!Jan 07, 2016', 'Yellow and lightly hazy with a thick fluffy white head. Pretty solid head retention, but not exceptional as head is slightly audible. Bouquet is fruit dominant: peaches, nectarines, also some apparent apricot and grape skins. Taste is similar with a but of a lemony citrus quality and moderate acidity.

Lovely nectarine and peach flavours, nice sourness, with hops providing a citrusy, grassy overtone. Low carbonation of course, as it is on cask. Wonderful.Oct 23, 2015', ""750ml, caged and corked Burgundian bottle. Muchas gracias once again to rogerdandy for setting me up with another potentially stellar BC offering.This beer pours a hazy, pale golden straw colour, with four fingers of puffy, finely foamy, and rather fizzy off-white head, which leaves a few instances of cannonball splash lace around the glass as it slowly and evenly abates. Lots of rising effervescence, as well.It smells of peppy orchard stone fruit - peach and nectarine, sure, but also underripe white grapes, lemon, and some pineapple core - a subtly milky sourness, softly bready and grainy pale malt, a bit of white cooking vinegar, faint pepper-like spice, and some tame musty, earthy bitterness. The taste is sharp, tart fruit anew, the nectarine, white peach, apricot, grape skins, lemon, and pineapple all mixing and mingling to great aplomb, while the grainy, lightly crackery malt stands at the ready, scanning the room for trouble, a meek sour milk thing hugs the walls, and some apple vinegar astringency bristles at getting its ID checked.The carbonation is quite active in its frothy and fizzy meanderings, but thankfully doesn't overfill my mouth - a typically unwelcome trait of these sorts of beers - the body an adequate medium weight, and generally smooth, a simple airy creaminess arising over time. It finishes off-dry, just, as the lingering fruitiness keeps the lurking (but good) beasties from fully bleeding this one, um, dry.A preposterously well-made sour beer, the balance achieved with the still over-the-top fruit character is remarkable. And no actual fruit added, it would seem (I first thought that I still had some juice on my hands from cleaning my toddler's face after he assaulted a nectarine earlier). Sheesh, this is so good, and that from a usually less than enthusiastic follower of the style.Aug 26, 2015"", 'This beer is simply phenomenal. There is so much on offer here for a lower abv beer with no fruit additions and only 6 IBU. The aroma alone is worth the price of admission. Brett trois puts an amazing finish to this lacto beast.Aug 12, 2015', ""A very nice beer... Originally it was a bit over-priced in the special bottle, but now it's a standard bomber. Not quit as hoppy as one might expect, but the Galaxy hops integrate incredibly well with the 'wild' fermentation and light tartness.2016 Canadian Brewing Award for THE best beer!Jul 19, 2015"", ""Thanks to FondueVoodoo for this bottle! This was a truly exceptional beer. The perfect amount of lacto complimented the brett. Fresh and juicy apricot and nectarine notes had me thinking that this was actually fruited (had to check the label to verify that it wasn't). Superb mouthfeel. Looking forward to trying the newest batch.Jul 04, 2015"", 'Exceptional wild ale. Fresh brett and some fruit in the aroma. Very lacy and sensuous looking. Soft mouthfeel, tart more than sour, and understated making for a wonderful drink. Very tasty with white peach and nectarine mostly. A little tropical, pineapple.Bottle from my main BC connect, thanks.Jun 27, 2015', 'Big thanks to Beervana for the bottle!Pours a hazy, golden color with a big white head good retention and lacing. The nose his tart with some floral hops and some light citrus notes (oranges and peaches). The taste is also tart with some acidity, light fruity notes for sweetness (peach, oranges, and a bit tropical) but still dry and nicely balanced finishing with some nice bittering hops and sour notes. Round but light on the palate with good carbonation. Overall, a really nice wild ale from a young brewery.Jun 23, 2015', 'Bottle: Poured a hazy pale yellow color ale with a large white foamy head with good retention and some good amount of lacing. Aroma of tart notes which are very balanced against light fruity notes and some dry floral hops notes. Taste is also a well-balanced mix between some light fruity notes with some dry floral hops notes and some tart notes. Body is full with good carbonation. Loads of very delicate and complex flavours that are well balanced and the overall beer is still very much drinkable.Jun 10, 2015', ""750ml corked and caged bottle poured into tulip 9/6/15 big thanks Rutager for the bottleA hazy glowing golden amber, a big fast stream of tiny bubbles feed a long lasting three finger cream colored head, lots of random lace deep down the glassS smells like a peach Bellini more then a beer, peach, nectarine, apricots, tangerine, lemon, pear, mango, pineapple, more citrus I can't place, it just explodes out of the glass, smells more like candy the a beer, crazy stuffT a little apple cider vinegar, tastes more dry then the candy I was smelling, much of the tropical notes still there just sour opposed to sweet, some sour kiwi fruit and a little earthy yeast, not exactly what I was expecting but still brilliantM fluffy, tangy, acidic and sour but not turning my mouth inside out, very slick, fairly dry finish, sour peachy finish, no complaints hereO the nose alone sets this one into its own class, truly amazing fruited sour Canadian or not this one would stand up to anything I've ever triedWell this ones got my interest in 4 winds going a little haywire, so much fruit its ridiculous, I'd believe juice before beer. This has to be one of the better beers I've had in recent memory and I imagine that its going to keep climbing the best of Canada list for some time.Jun 09, 2015"", 'Just pulled a bottle out of my cellar, so it is now 2-3 months since release. The peach-nectarine nose is more subdued, but way more tartness is present in the first tastes. There is more carbonation and the ever present sourness is really changing and becoming more intense.Mar 23, 2015', ""Glowing peach skin hued body topped by a billowing three finger head. Intensely juicy, tropical aroma. Pineapple, kumquat, guava, peach - an awesome mix of stonefruit and citrus, leaning toward the citrus side of things. Sharp acidity stings the nostrils a bit. It's been a while since I've had a sour beer with a nose quite this amazing. On the plate it's similarly juicy, tart and tropical. Guava, pineapple, peach. Bright and scrubbing acidity with a crisp mouthfeel; lighter bodied, but full flavored.

Just stunningS: Sweet stone fruit, sour citrus, a bit of mild acidityT: Incredibly fruity. Nectarine, peach, with a hint of pear. Unbelievable that there is no fruit in this beer whatsoever. Sour without being overly acidic, just very well integrated.F: Above average carbonation, fits with the beer. Possibly the best beer to come out of BC ever. Will be eagerly awaiting more of this when my supply finally runs dry (it won't be long)Jan 25, 2015"", ""Reviewing a fresh bottle.Pours a hazy light orange colour with a big soapy white head. A bold yet delicate smell dominated by stone fruit; ripe nectarine, apricot, peach, a bit of mango, and maybe some white grape as well. Taste is slightly more restrained, those same fruit flavours come through but with a light cracker malt to back them up. Just the slightest bit tart and very little brett funk. A bit of a wheat character on the back end. Mouthfeel is soft and drying.Overall, a very unique and delicious beer from Four Winds. This is one I've had multiple times in varying conditions, and contrary to popular opinion, I actually prefer this beer with some age on it. The fruity hop flavours seem to have no trouble hanging on and there's a wonderful sourness that become much more evident with a bit of time.Jan 25, 2015"", 'Appearance.

Service: Bottle chilled. Poured to a tulip. Thanks Ben!Great pour. Bright orange hue with substantial head. Mildly hazy. Solid head that had staying power. Looks great!Aroma is in your face. Straight off the pour. Fresh citric hop and green goodness.Taste : Very solid but singular and to the point. Grassy and citrus. Substantial malt invests. Lingering aftertaste of a nice blend of malts and hop bettering. Mouth feel was substantial. I like it and is required in my mind for a solid IPA. Tongue was caressed by fine bubbles which added to the back of mouth elements of this brew. Overall: I was thinking this beer had a hard task to live up to its reputation but I was very pleasantly surprised. They have something great going on here! I feel it may be partly the fact that they use copious amounts of hops on a great IPA malt backbone. It works and I approve.Oct 19, 2016"", 'Pours a deep golden with whitish frothy two finger head. Aroma is slightly tropical but heavier to pine and grass. Flavour starts with a hint of sweetness then moves to earthy pine and grass notes. Hop bite up front is assertive but not off putting. Finishes with an earthy chewy dryness.Oct 18, 2016', 'This review is one of two fresh hop ale reviews - the other being Yellow Dog Brewery’s Alpha Dog 2106 release. I made these reviews as a challenge by an acquaintance who said that Alpha Dog was a way better beer than Driftwood’s Sartori Harvest. As I have not had the privilege to try either until now, I figured a good head to head taste off was in order (pun intended). See here (https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/35919/193023/?ba=JonCorbett#review) for my review of Alpha Dog. Appearance: Clear and golden amber with a generous one and half fingers of rocky white fluff and leaves in it’s moderate dissipation a decent amount of crocheted lace about the glass. Gentle carbonation bubbles float to the top in a fairly uniform manner. (4.5)Aromatics: Fairly mellow - I found it actually quite lacking from what I was expecting. But it was fresh with sweet grasses and hop juice, some light florals with honey malt and subtle yellow grapefruit and pomelo citrus. (3.75)Taste: Sweet pine nut start and the flavour briskly drops into a smooth earthy green pine resin. The sweet malts do a wonderful job of bringing along the hoppy bitter with very skillful balance that sees it finish of sweeter than the start. There is a pretty good earthy aftertaste that combines with the bitter mouthfeel at the end. (4.25)Feel: Middleweight through and through with a moderate carbonation and a grainy wooden grapefruit peel bitter that lingers across most of the palate. (4)Overall: So overall… In my opinion Satori edged out Alpha Dog in appearance, and flavour, but I give Aroma and Feel to Alpha Dog - Overall I think they are fairly equivalent. Different qualities for sure but both come in with a decent 4.25 overall. (And in the end with the rating system, Satori eeked out the win by a margin of just .03) Two great fresh hop brews for sure, so try to get them yourself and decide which is the better...Pairing : Salt. I enjoyed the tamed bitter, but its the sweeter flavours that even though are behind the scenes are the ones that real make the whole show happen in this one. And those sweet flavours need a good salty counter balance. After enjoying half of my bomber sample I personally went with a Jalapeño and Cheddar popcorn blended with double butter popcorn - the extra butter helped out the bitter linger a bit on the palate while the spice and salty added an nice flavour enhancement. I think atmosphere-wise, Satori is better suited to open public forums, where as I found Alpha Dog to be a more intimate and relaxing brew.Oct 15, 2016', 'Got on a CANBIF trade! Thx westcoastbeergeek! Served at 4deg C in a draught glassA- Opens well and pours a 1"" high white head that lasts for nearly 5mins before film out. Very dark almost an orange/gold colour.

Has a good hop base but the bitterness level is pretty low considering that this brew is a IIPA in training. M- Dry and crisp. Bite on the tongue happens at the endO- Very good brew. Will buy if I ever see it around but BC brews are not distributed very well here in Ontario. Too bad really as there some prime beer examples out there.Food PairingThis wonderful little brew went very well with........ Chili! Nice ground beef chili with red kidney beans, onions, tomato soup condensed and mushrooms. Drain off a bit of the grease after frying the beef so the chili is not too greasy. Don\'t forget 4 tablespoons of chili powder to 3lbs of meat.

Very fresh and green, with almost a hint of Sorachi Ace-esque lemon (although I don't think that hop was used here). Not much malt; very neutral, bready backdrop.T - The taste has a bit more doughy, caramel sweetness from the malt, but it's still quite hop-forward with plenty of herbal, green, dank herb, and bitter grapefruit hoppiness.M - Medium body, pleasant carbonation, dry finish, with oily wet hops and a dry, crisp finish. Spot on for the style.D - I'm generally lukewarm to 'wet hop' beers, but this is quite nice; I can see why it's so popular. Still, the hop character is somewhat retro for my more 'American' palate.

Just a bit hazy and more of a golden color than I remember with a beautiful head and lacing. Spicy, earthy and herbal hops fill the aroma with a bit of grassy character. Similar in the flavor, heavily earthy and green, with some grassiness. Maybe lacking a bit of the fineness of previous years, but really enjoyable.2011 bottle review:Driftwood Satori Harvest pours a slightly hazy light amber with a nice head that slowly fades. The aroma is big, pungent grapefruit and dry orange citrus hops with a nice spiciness and allusions to a bold bitterness. Some sweet pale malt pokes through just a bit in flavor, followed by a big citrusy hop burst. There is tons of resiny grapefruit flavor, but also plenty of herbal, slightly earthy and spicy hop character. The resiny bitterness lingers in the finish. This is the best wet hopped IPA I've had, really showcasing the Centennial hops.Oct 05, 2013"", ""Bottled on Friday and drank the following Tuesday. (09/20/2013 and 09/24/2013 respectively)This is the kind of freshness that Sartori Harvest IPA deserves. Anyone who cooks knows the quality difference between dried herbs and fresh herbs, especially if it's a major component of the final dish's flavour. That same difference in flavour quality shines right through with this fresh-hopped IPA. Appearance: Sartori pours a rich golden yellow with big fluffy head and good retention.Smell: The hops are floral, very fresh, plus orange and a little lemon. Really pleasant – no off-notes at all, just fresh fragrance – like big green leaves. No bitterness.Taste: Typically we describe hoppy beers in terms of other flavours – be it citrus fruits, woody notes, or floral qualities. Well to be honest, after spending a few minutes studying what I was tasting, the best description I can come up with is that it tastes like hops. Truly and more accurately than usually possible, this beer has a real fresh hops flavour in it. You can taste the greenness of the hops, the oils are balanced and gentle, yet rich. There is very little bitterness for the amount of flavour. I would say it’s primarily orange citrus as far as influential flavours, with a background of both rose petals and rose stems.Finish: It finishes with a gentle drying bitterness that isn’t overly potent but does last. The oils are left behind to some extent. It is earthy, but not woody.Side Note: This isn't a huge IPA - it's not a hop monster like most DIPA's tend to be. This is all about quality over quantity, even though it's still very much hop-forward.Sep 24, 2013"", 'Quite a lot of floral notes this year. Exceptionally good. Light on the nose and in the mouth. Those fresh hops are really shining through with minimal bitterness,, which I must say is a bit unusual. Very, very balanced. I imagine in a week or two and this will be a completely different beer so do try now. Definitely better than last year and would highly recommend a try. Nice job! Please release more :)Sep 24, 2013', ""650 mL btl served at 7C in a tulip. Just a little experiment to see how it developed. I know it is a fresh, wet, single source hop IPA that is meant to be had fresh; but frankly I was unimpressed with this year's offering on the day of release and it got better during the ensuing days/weeks. Hence the tasting now.AVERAGE SCORE should be 4.75 at leastSlightly pale, matte amber pour with slight copper/orange tones. Nice frothy off white head that ends quickly but laces well and good carbonation (etched tulip helps) gives it a lasting film. 3-4 protein clumps and slight sediment.Very low nose, mainly pine and orange with a mildly sweet note. Very muted, but expected.Beautifully balanced. Overtones of orange, slightly fresh not but hints of older (not stale) citrus oils. Nice solid malty base that is mildly sweet, some bread and gentile but precise yeast quantity. Hops, mainly citrus and leafy. Only slightly bitter but a fresh resin note that is oily in texture but also effervesent. This hits every layer of hops. Muted floral notes with a titch of berry and forest bush.Medium to heavy body with the carbonation giving zesty contrast to its weight and perking up the citrus flavours and holding up the mid-level hops. Dry-ish finish that is still satisfying enough that i don't feel like i need to have more, but i really want to. I may have given this a 4 on first release. Maybe. It was unbalanced in my view. This on the other hand is fucking fantastic. IPAs are not my favorite. By the balance and depth of this, especially in the malt is amazing. the lack of nose is the only thing that keeps it out of the 5s as it hold back slightly the flavour profile of the more fragrant hops. While not a traditional IPA, for what it is this, NOW is in the top 3 beers I have ever had.Jan 09, 2013"", ""A: A golden copper clear IPA with bubbly and foamy head that initally was 2 fingers and slowly settles leaving lacing along the glass and plenty of variable bubbles. S:Big fruity smells of peach, melon, pineapple and sweet maltiness. The hops show through with notes grapefruit and pine sap, with a trace of minerals at the very end. T: Pine sap & grapefruit up front, the hops are bright and pop, then quick subside and allow sweet and smooth malty notes in the mid point, the malts to shine through to support the bright hops. There is a mineral trace in the background that reminds me of the hard water mineral flavour.M: Light to medium bodied with a buzz of carbonation all the way through. A light syrup mouthfeel coats the palette and give the brew a subtle body while the carbonation is refreshing. O: I like this beer more than I expected - I worried it wouldn't hold up to the hype. It's bright and malty, light and carbonated - it's one of the best examples of a West Coast IPA for my dollar. I'm a serious fan of Naughty Hildegard and this is yet another great example of Driftwood's exceptional skills.Jan 06, 2013"", ""So, Rutager tricked my buddy into giving him my address here in Holland so he could send me this surprise. Thanks heaps man! Living where I do, surprises like this are few and far between. Very much appreciated.From a bomber into a snifterAPPEARANCE: Pours a two finger, medium looking, off-white head with good retention. Head becomes a little foamy after some time, but slowly fades to a full foam cap. Gamboge orange in color with almost no carbonation evident. A splotchy wisp remains leaving some foamy lacing down the glass. Nice looking beer, though the head ends up a little on the foamy side for my liking. SMELL: Wonderful nose on this. Honeydew melon, lots of pineapple, orange peel and some nice lemon notes as well. Very nice, bold fruits on this one, with a touch of pale and caramel malts as well. Very nice. TASTE: Starts with some pale malts, sweet caramel notes and some honeydew melon up front. Flavor becomes more forthcoming after the swallow, with floral and piney, bitter hops, touches of orange peel, lemon, and some light hints of honeydew melon. Delicious for sure, but the flavor doesn't quite match the magic that is the aroma. More pine and floral forward than expected. PALATE: Medium body and medium levels of carbonation. Not quite as creamy as hoped, a touch prickly perhaps, goes down fine and finishes somewhat dry on the palate. Enough weight, but not quite as smooth and creamy as expected. OVERALL: The nose on this was spectacular, but the flavor wasn't quite in the same league. The aroma prepared me for a melony, fruity hop bomb, but instead, the flavor showcased more floral and pine qualities. The feel was also not quite as smooth as I'd expected. Despite the slight identity crisis here, this is still a top class, enjoyable beer from a brewery that has done nothing but impress me so far. These guys might be my favorite in Canuckville.

A closer sniff revealed some bready malt and I found a bit of a honey-like sweetness in the background. The flavors were good, solid malts which gave a nice foundation to a variety of hop flavors.

Even at a 7%, this is still a nice beer to sit bank and enjoy.Oct 03, 2010"", ""A- Pours a clear light amber with a finger of beautiful white head. Head recedes, leaving a light layer of foam. Lots of carbonation bubbles rise from the bottom of my glass. S- Nice floral and citrus hops. A faint pine smell comes through. The citrus is most prevalent, but blends beautifully with the rest of the scents. T- Strangely, the pine comes through first with the citrus following behind. A bit of alcohol is evident, but beautifully balanced. Floral notes are subtly showing through under all the tastes from beginning to end. Very smooth taste. This beer has great balance. M- Medium bodied and smooth. Perfect carbonation. D- One of the better IPAs that I've tasted. Very smooth and balanced. I could definitely drink this all night. Too bad for the limited run. I would love to be able to get more of this stuff.Sep 30, 2010"", "" oz bottle, ritzkiss shared this one with me.Pours a clear amber/orange, nice and bright, thick slightly off white head forms, drops a ton of lace spots, settles down to a pretty thick layer, good retention.Smell is nice, tea, lemons, floral, very malty, caramel sweetness, toast, biscuit, crackers, light grapefruit and pine, big malt and big hops, very fresh aroma.Taste is similar, big and malty at first, honey and caramel, toast, lemon and tea, grapefruit, some floral, nicely balanced, big lemony and bitter finish.Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, very dry and bitter in the finish but still nicely balanced. Didn't realize this was 7% at first, one of the pieces of the puzzle on how that night went so wrong. Thanks Eric!Nov 27, 2009"", 'Bottle: Poured a lightly hazy bright light orangey with a medium size head with OK retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of floral hops with light citrus and bitter finish is quite enjoyable. Taste is also a nice mix between some floral hops with some nice clean citrus notes with a medium bitter finish and light sweet malt backbone. Body is quite full with good carbonation and no appearance of alcohol thought it can be felt at the end of the glass. Nothing extraordinary but well done nonetheless.Nov 20, 2009', 'I agree , this is a great IPA with a fantastic frsh hop nose and lovely thick mouthfeel with real balance in the main body. These guys are showing why they can compete with the best In BC by making an IPA as good as Central City or Phillips. They need to create a regular IPA that is available all year roundOct 29, 2009', ""Bomber shared by Ritzkiss - thanks Eric!Pours a rich copper colour with a creamy off-white head that shows excellent retention and leaves huge sheets of lace. The nose is a fragrant bouquet of grapefruit, pine, apricot and caramel. It certainly sets the table for the flavour, and serves as a great advert for this beer.The body is far heavier than you will usually find in an IPA, and has a wonderful creamy smoothness. Its actually more reminiscent of a double IPA, but of course the ABV isn't there to match that. Mmmm... let's call it an IPA and a half.The flavour seems to be mostly about sweet citrus. There's definitely some tangerine, clementine and candied orange in there, and it seems to be mixing in with a big dose of pine. While all of these flaavours come from the hopping, the bitterness is no where near excessive, and its extremely drinkable. Not that its all about hops either, and the malt brings a nice caramel aspect.An impressively drinkable west coast IPA. Not as bitter as most, but also better than most. Driftwood's successful run continues.Oct 17, 2009"", ""First time reviewer, greetings.Driftwood is the most interesting local brewery we have in Victoria in my opinion. The Farmhand Ale in particular is beautifully fresh and drinkable.I picked this up at the Hillside Liquor Store where I work in the fridge. The label design, like all Driftwood's stuff, is a tasteful and bold graphic artwork, this time of some ripe hops. A: Rich and orange like a bronzed mango, with an enduring head.S: Dull, warm citrus pierced with a hint of near-medicinal pine aromas.T: Surprisingly not as bitter as I expected from a fresh hop brew. More of the pine comes out in the flavour, giving an otherwise restrained IPA a lively, tonic-like quality that makes you open your eyes and smile.M: Smooth with a hint of a tannic pucker, very pleasant.D: I'd stick to one per session, but I could drink one every other night while it's in season. My first wet hop brew, so I can't put it into context, but this is a beer with real impact. If I had to criticize it, I'd say, like a few of Driftwood's beers, this one could accommodate another percentage point in the ABV. The kick is slightly wanting for such a flavourful beer. But I'm nitpicking... Great beer.Oct 15, 2009"", ""2oz fresh from Victoria, pours a gorgeous burnished orange with copper and amber hints, 2 fingers of sticky off white foam with great retention and lacing down the glass.Loads of floral and grapefruit hops in the nose. Hints of pine and lemons, a light kiss of caramel. Sweet and fresh.This is a balanced beer, not as hoppy as you might expect. Nice fresh, lively floral and citrus notes, followed by a nice light caramelly sweetness, a delicate balance. Hints of grass, lemons, pine in the burps for sure. Lots of hop flavor, just not a ton of hop bite in the finish. This dances over the tongue rather than browbeating it with hoppy bitterness. I feel perhaps at 7% it should go for a little more browbeating but it's hard to complain how frickin' drinkable this is. Still some bite, especially as I clear the palate - it's actually somewhere in the middle, lots of piney resin in the finish.Not a hop monster, just a well made Canadian IPA with plenty of hop action going on. Lively but light silky carb. Some residual sugar makes the body a touch thicker, adds to the slick silky mouthfeel. It's good.Oct 13, 2009"", ""Wet Centennial hops from the Sartori Cedar Ranch hop farm, south of Chilliwack, BC. 66 IBU.A: Copper-bronze with a huge, off-white head, great retention & exceptional lacing.S: Apricot, nectarine & tangerine with a little grass & pine. Slight underlying sweet toffee aroma. Not a huge aroma (could it use some more late/dry hopping?), but it's quite nice.T: Nice leafy hop flavours: nectarine, apricot, grass; toffee & caramel; very smooth bitterness; alcohol is subtle.M: Moderate body has a slight residual sweetness.D: A good drinker.A good IPA, but it doesn't match the Sierra Nevada fresh/wet brews.They picked up the hops & brewed the next day, so I guess putting the wet hops aside for 'dry' hopping doesn't really fit the theme. I'd say it could use a little more hopping at flame-out (or in the whirlpool if they use one) for an IPA. Man I love the centennial. :DPicked up at Point Grey Beer & Wine on Broadway in Vancouver.Oct 12, 2009"", ""Another winner from Driftwood, not sure if this will be a one time brew or become a seasonal fall release. What I do know is that I will need to buy quite a bit of it either way.Pours a rich golden orange colour with decent slightly off white head.Aromas of honey citrus and pine, you can definitely tell the difference wet hopping makes the hop aromas are far more subdued, and reminds me a lot of sticky pine resin smell.Hop flavours integrate really nicely on the palate with the caramel smooth malt presence. Really reminds me of a honey grapefruit type thing.Mouth feel is awesome, just smooth creamy and dense, great weight and probably perfect carbonation, exactly what I would want in an IPA.Great IPA, not the best I've ever had but I would put it up there against the best of them from BC at least.Oct 11, 2009""]",https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/18858/53309/

I had to pour this out.Apr 19, 2018"", 'definitely one of the better hoppy beers i had in ontario last week, very west coast, which is a refreshing change of pace from the new school juice bomb wannabes and the overly english influenced examples of the style that seem far more common around the province. this is still pretty malty, with a light copper shine to it from the tap and plenty of body. its not sweet though, which is the key, and while there is of course a light crystal character to it, its simple and cleaned up well by the basically flavorless ale yeast. it would be bland or even dumbed down tasting to me if it werent for all these hops! huge aromatics of cut pine and tangerine rise up, something a little more tropical too, and a sweet oily freshness makes it sink in in the flavor, it comes early and stays late, and its backed up by fairly robust bitterness on the finish, still in nice balance, but this is more like a classic california ipa than anything else i found on my trip. drinkable for its strength and heft, felt kind of wintery to me, but its winter now, so that works. cool beer, maybe a little overrated as its not the most original thing out there, but its a darn fine beer. i wish i got my lips on more driftwood stuff while i was up there...Feb 13, 2018', 'Appearance: Looks radiantly cloudy yellow.Smell: Piney with citrus notes and sweet melonsTaste: Tastes of pine up front that mellows into a sweet citrus/grapefruit and melon backbone.Jan 14, 2018', 'Clear golden color with white head. Aroma has some butter biscuits and resiny hops and some overripe tropical fruits. Taste follows with buttery notes but not in a bad way at all. Towards the finish it gets quite bitter with lingering grapefruit notes. Medium body and carbonation. Quite good overall, a more old school take on an IPA but I really enjoyed it.Jan 08, 2018', 'Reviewed from (long-standing) notes. Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into an unmarked pint glass.A: Very hazy orange-gold, with a low level of visible carbonation after the initial blush fades. Forms about a finger’s worth of white head with good retention.S: Citrus rind, sticky pine, and biscuit malts with significant amount of caramel sweetness. Smells like a standard of a bygone era of IPAs.T: The bitterest of grapefruit pith, and caramelized malts with accompanying big malty sweetness. Resinous bitterness as well. There’s a weird vegetal flavor – I think it\'s coming from the hops, but it\'s unwelcome here...almost plasticky. A significant bitterness in the hang, but not completely over the top, with some citrus pith flavors.M: Average body for style. The alcohol presence is low. Low carbonation sensation.O: I was surprised to see the ratings this beer has. Maybe there was something wrong with this bottle, but this isn\'t good. It\'s not quite a drain pour to me, but it\'s an ""actively avoid"" in the way of advice. First, there are many better IPAs and DIPAs available wherever you live. Secondly, the hop profile is completely boring – or at least old-school – but not really well done even with that as a standard. Plus the caramel malts are my least favorite IPA character. Lastly, the weird vegetal/plasticky flavor is off-putting. I\'m still not sure where it\'s coming from, but it\'s not good. Anyway, drinkable at best...but not by much.Oct 28, 2017', ""From a 650ml bottle served almost straight from the fridge at 10 degrees Celsius into a stemmed IPA glass. Best before date Dec.6.2017 which makes me think the bottle has been sitting at the LCBO shelves for a while. Out of the two dates I found this one was later in the year. Fingers crossed.Look: The beer pours a slightly veiled amber with 6cm of moussy, rocky, tan head that settles into a craggy though solid cap within 5+ minutes. Good lacing with persistent retention. Great-looking beer.Smell: Leaning towards mild intensity and sharp balance. Dominating hops with a faint, supportive pale malt. Pungent with resinous pine, citrusy grapefruit, and a faint, perfumy floral character. I really like it but I wish it hit me slightly harder. I'm also noticing a faint, fatty, cheesy off-note that makes me suspect a form of contamination. Since the bottle is only a few months away from expiry, who knows what the beer has gone through at this point.Taste: Moderate strength and bitter. Very much in line with the aroma. Hop-forward with notes of resinous pine, citrusy grapefruit, and tropical fruit. The finish is of medium length and bitter with moderate intensity and a minute mineral character.Feel: Medium body with moderate carbonation. Creamy and round with smooth alcohol warming that is light in character. The beer has quite a presence in the mouth.Overall: A very good, clean American IPA with decent complexity and strong bitterness. Great value - try it if you're into the style. As I mentioned under the aroma, I suspect something is gone wrong with this sample. I'm looking forward to trying the beer fresh and possibly rating it even higher.Sep 10, 2017"", 'A really nice surprise. Pours golden hay with decent head that lasted fairly well. Very good nose! Fruity florals and a solid presence. Tastes true IPA solid bitter and solid body. Heavy sedimentation so didnt pour all and would recommend a slow pour for those for whom sludge is a turn off. Does pour clear with slow, staggered pour into tulip glass. Sediment will be contained this way. well done B.C!Sep 01, 2017', '650 ml bottle from Newfoundland Liquor Corporation: Pours a slightly misty straw yellow with a huge head that dissipates slowly leaving generous lacing. Aroma is intense grapefruit some pine notes malt sweetness almost indistinguishable at these hopping rates. In the flavour the hoppiness adds a slight grassiness. Citrus still dominant but the bitterness is pretty clean through the mouth and now some sweetness appears - mostly melon and honey. This is a beer for hopheads without doubt but that does not mean that it is uncomplicated. This beer is strong and hoppy but not overwhelming. I am a little surprised to see it called a Northwestern IPA because its malt profile and appearance seem to me to be closer to a New England IPA.Aug 25, 2017', ""This is a local IPA for me. It's an intense hop-heavy IPA with a bright nose and strong malt backbone. It's like eating a grapefruit dipped in caramel. I admire Driftwood for putting something so hoppy out there for those of us who really enjoy our hop flavour.Jul 09, 2017"", '5/19/17...pours cloudy bronze, with hefty white foam, about a 1/4 inch thick.

Then some mildly sweet flavors of caramel and citrus come in. The malt character is hearty and brings a good balance. The after-taste is slightly hoppy and slightly sweet.M: Crisp and smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is clean for the style.O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, this is a solid IPA to drink for a while.May 24, 2017', ""On tap at Cardero's in Vancouver, BC. Pours a slightly hazy amber with a nice off-white head. Initial impresson is malt sweetness with citrus and resinous hops underlying. Finish is a little sweet. Would be exceptional if the malt were dialed back a bit.May 24, 2017"", ""Golden and clear (for an unfiltered) pour. Not much head or lacing compared to other IPAs. Nose is also subtle for the style but very balanced, and I'm seeing that as a good thing in this case. Taste above all is exceptional.

Some notes of pine and cracked peppercorns. Complex and very flavorful. Medium in mouthfeel... a bit oily. Finish is clean and citrusy.O: A rock solid Canadian West Coast IPA.

Loved it, and I'd have this any time.Mar 03, 2017"", 'L: sparkling honey juiceN: loads of pine sapT: piney, citrus, balanced by an herbal maltiness that curbs the bitterness. Solid.

An amazing tropical aroma and exactly what I look for in American IPAs.T: The sweet flavours come through but are quickly overtaken by a resinous hop bitterness in the finish. A perfect balance of sweet and bitter.F: Medium body and medium to high carbonation. Could be more full-bodied, with all of these big flavours it comes across a bit watery but still solid.O: One of the best American IPAs brewed in Canada I've ever had.

Only after I got home and poured it out could I finally see this faint dating on the neck of the bottle in the light and I was kind of disappointed. To have a bottling date is great, but it should also be clearly shown… not hidden away only to be seen at certain angles.A 650ml bottle with a bottled on date of 12th April 2016, poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass.Appearance: It poured a slightly hazy golden orange colour with a big three finger off white head that had good retention and left lots of sticky lacing.Aroma: Strong orange, orange juice and orange zest aromas, tropical mango and passionfruit notes here and there along with pine and light caramel.Taste: Lightly bitter citrus grapefruit, orange and orange zest.

Moderate foamy head that lasts a while. Decent glass lacing. Cirtusy nose. Hop forward on the tongue, not very complex, a pleasant oiliness in the backwash. No lingering astringency, a little resiny aftertaste. Clean, relatively dry finish. A visit to the website reveals: 7% abv, 80 ibu, and Citra and Amarillo in the mix....right in my wheelhouse. A satisfying brew that's far too easy to drink. A very good example of the PNW American IPA style. and one of very few decent Canadian IPAs I have found. For those in the BC market, I would state Fat Tug is (objectively and hands-down) a MUCH better beer than Steamworks Flagship IPA...which I only mention because the latter was --- somehow, incredibly --- just voted Best BC Craft Beer (!??).

As it dissipates it leaves behind a generous amount of clinging lace and rocky surface formations. Aromatics: Plenty of bright citrus (grapefruit, lime), tropical notes (mango, passionfruit), and resinous pine, some milder underlying tones of biscuit and caramel malts.Taste: Fair bit of grain in amongst the IPA hoppy goodness.Feel: A light crisp but buttery texture in this middleweight. Finishes fairly strong but clean with a bit of Simcoe hop earthy linger and a very warming tingle at the back of the throat.Overall: A superb 7% IPA with the right (complex) blend of flavour (aroma+taste) and a delightful mouthfeel. Well worth its place in the Canada top 100.Pairing : This is an IPA worthy of a fine cut of beef - either BBQ Prime Rib or just a good ol charred up tender and juicy rib eye.

Retention is pretty good and the foam leaves lots of lacing on the glass. The beer is a light-golden color with just a hint of haze and some carbonation to be seen.S-The aroma is snappy and hop-forward like you would expect from something that bills itself as a NW IPA. The flavors lean towards earthy and citrusy (like orange zest and grapefruit) instead of juicy or tropical. Malts are not completely overwhelmed and there is a good biscuit and bread aroma.T-The taste, like the smell, is zesty and sharp versus outright bitter. I taste pine, some grapefruit, orange zest. It is a bit vague, but that is probably my palate letting me down, not the beer. Pale biscuit-y malts are mild, but not completely missing.M-The beer has a great feel with a medium heft and a semi-crisp carbonation. It drinks mostly clean, but leaves a little bit of hop residue on my palate.O-This is a solid IPA that I would probably drink regularly if I lived in the area.

Enough malt and biscuit additions to make it balanced and complex, the aroma releases lemon zest and more fruit notes later on.The taste is similar to the nose with potent citrus up front including grapefruit, orange peel, clementine, guava, tropical fruits, light piney hops, buttery biscuit, graham cracker, fruity candy like gummy bears, earthy notes and spices such as pepper and coriander.

The malts have a taste of mango, peach and a little bit of honey. The finish tasted like smoked hops and there was a little bit of spice because of the subtle carbonation. The pine woods come in.Feel: The beer is full-bodied. Despite its high volume alcohol, the warmth of the alcohol is barely felt on the taste buds as well as in the throat, which is unusual for an IPA. This is the most bitter Canadian IPA I have ever had. Although the beer is dry, it is not astringent and it barely dehydrate the mouth.Overall: For a North American beer, this beer stood out because of its perfect head retention.

Carbonation looked pretty lively.Aroma - The first aromas to hit my nose, were big citrus notes, I got grapefruit, orange, a little mango, then a strong pine after that followed by some light caramel malts. Taste - the flavor profile followed suit all the same flavors and you get hit with a strong bitterness around the time the pine comes in which is then mellowed by the caramel.Feel - This beer had a medium-full body which was nice, Most IPA's ive had tend to sit on the other side of the medium spectrum, It had a very creamy body also and was smooth on the finish.

Nice lacing.There\'s the expected grapefruit and pine, plus some gentler floral and fruity aromas. It\'s very west coast, but not in that aggressively dank ""let\'s rip a couple bong hits"" way some of these IPAs can be. The fruitiness of (I\'m guessing) Centennial hops is certainly the dominant note here. The aromatic hops are balanced by some bitterness and just the right amount of malt sweetness.Creamy and effervescent.This is a classic west-coast IPA.

I had heard that the LCBO was bringing this in, but did not expect it to be stocked locally. What a nice surprise!Pours a translucent golden-amber hue, complete with a pillowy, sparkling white-coloured head about two fingers high. Good retention; it seeps away steadily over the next 5-10 minutes, depositing a gorgeous curtain of scattered lace, and eventually receding to a half-cm of dense, creamy foam. Citrusy orangepeel and grapefruit come through on the nose, as do pronounced pine needle and resin notes. I'm also getting a few hints of peach, lychee and honeydew melon, with a touch of caramel.Oh man, it's been a while since I've had the chance to experience a brand new top shelf IPA. The hops are supported by a respectable shelf of biscuity malts and caramelized sugar sweetness, but this one focuses mostly on the resiny, piney hop flavours. Subtle flavours of apricot, canteloupe and passion fruit are easily lost amidst the resin - and they don't fare any better once you hit the citrus-forward back end, which is dominated by pithy grapefruit and a combination of grassy, floral, herbal bitterness at the finish. Bitter, resiny aftertaste that persists well after each sip. Full-medium body, with delicate carbonation levels and an exceedingly smooth, soft, borderline creamy feel on the palate. No sign of the alcohol really, so it drinks like a dream; this is exactly what I am looking for in this style.Really glad to finally cross this long-time want off my list... and given the reasonable price I'll probably pick up a few more bombers.[Updated Jan 28 2020]I haven't seen any Fat Tug at an LCBO for a while now, and this is the first time it has come in a convenient tallboy format (best before May 21 2020). This remains one of the most fawning reviews I've ever given any kind of IPA, because at the time I felt it exemplified the best qualities of the West Coast style in particular. Revisiting it for the first time in a while, I feel no particular compulsion to change a thing, because this is absolutely still one of the best, smoothest IPAs I've ever had. The hazy and milkshake-type IPAs that have mesmerised consumers and brewers alike as of late may (or may not) eventually prove to be fads... but you can't fake quality, and the depth of Fat Tug's is abyssal.

The taste is more gritty, grainy pale malt, a suggestion of biscuity caramel, peppy pine resin and citrus pith (white grapefruit and underripe navel orange, for the trainspotters), that same flinty essence carrying on from the nose, and a respectful cold steely alcohol, er, warming.The bubbles are quite innocuous in their quotidian and frothy meanderings, the body a solid enough middleweight, and replete with a hollow-seeming smoothness. It finishes on a strong drying trend, the fruity and bitter green hop essences justifying their purported skin in the game.Well, the long-term hype machine is justified, it would seem - this is a stand-up, big-boy hoppy IPA, the malt paid only contractual lip service (wait, whut?).

More malt than expected, but I like it.Dec 20, 2013', ""Fat Tug IPA is a clear, copper wire coloured ale with the complexion of ghee (clarified butter). Such a tone, though clean, turns transparency into mere translucency; it's like looking through a block of ice. Its head is built like a wrestler - stout and thick - and piledrives foam onto the glass. The nose boasts papaya and mango in both their fresh, vividly citric as well as candied, dried states. There's also an accompanying cast of grapefruit, melon, lime, lychee and even a spritz of guava. It is a market of exotic, tropical fruits with an overlay of dank, grassy herbals.The flavour is so full of pine needles, lawn clippings and orange wedges that all the honey and eggbread flavour from the malts goes largely unnoticed. Even as far as sweetness goes, the candied citrus and guava notes are right on par with any notions of caramel or toffee. For the craft beer lover, hops reach the brain's pleasure zones via the same neurological circuitry as salt, sugar, or fat - it's an innate craving that provides an immediate hit. And like the latter, sometimes you just can't get enough. Fat Tug IPA certainly hits that 'bliss point'. It was some time before Canadian brewers offered the same kind of juicy, citric IPAs that made their American counterparts famous - those days are over.

This beer is one of Driftwood\'s mainstays.Poured from a 22 oz. bottle to a pint glass. Served north of 50º Fahrenheit.(Appearance) Pours a sudsy froth head of a golden cream tone over a mildly hazy amber body with moderate carbonation. Retention is above average, lacing is medium-dense and clingy. It\'s an unfiltered IPA, which leads to a slight uncommon haziness. 4(Smell) Aromas of pine, citrus ream and tropical fruit over a light bready caramel and pale malt base. This isn\'t a striking or overly bright-smelling IPA but it does have an enjoyable hop aroma, modest in presentation, it stands at par with the malt profile. A mild peppery character is a curious addition, perhaps suggesting a hint of rye. Potency is medium. 4(Taste) Up front, the malt bill is relatively clean and a touch viscous, with a lightly toasted barley malt, some biscuity malt, questionably rye, and most notably by the sweet, slick finish, a pinch of honey malt, or just honey. There\'s a good balance between the malt character and hop bitterness, although the hop flavors aren\'t very charismatic, there\'s a substantial bitterness to confirm this as a bold IPA. 4(Mouthfeel) Texture is slick first, smooth second. Carbonation plays a mellow role in adding some air to the texture, but keeps very tame, more so compared to American IPAs. Balance is slightly bitter over sweet, although it remains close, with a fuller body than expected. Body is medium/high for an American IPA, medium+ overall. The beer finishes favorably bitter with a clean, very slick and resinous finish. 4.5(Overall) Victoria\'s Driftwood Brewery crafts a thoroughly enjoyable American IPA, with a solid malt sweetness and a moderate hop flavor and bitterness to pair, it\'s a more heavy-drinking IPA than I\'m used to, but a treat to savor nonetheless.

Overall a solid IPA, one of my favorite IPAs.Apr 26, 2013', ""Thanks to Rutager for sending this extra from one of my favorite locals in North America, Vancouver. 22 oz. bottle split with my wife while watching the end of The Truman Show, which happenend to be our first date. Well, second first date. Nevermind.Pour is an unclear but not hazy orange with gentled carbonation. Nose is a fall cornucopia of fruits: honeydew, grapefruit, orange, pale malts. Going in the correct direction. Fat Tug begs for a comment, so I'm not going to make one. Lovely hops on this babe, reaching out & giving the tongue a good shlap of bitterness, followed with fainter flavors of pine, citrus. The bitterness doing the tugging here. Nice pale malts, light sweetness. Drinkable. I could do this bomber. Nice IPA that showcases bitterness, but without a whole lot of complexity. Luckily, that's my favorite part of an IPA. Very good beer.Mar 26, 2013"", 'Picked up a bottle of this at a BCLS earlier this wonderful evening. Unfortunately, Driftwood doesn\'t yet date their bottles, so I have no idea how fresh this is. Given that this IPA is somewhat hop-heavy, that is somewhat important and should probably be rectified sooner rather than later.I\'m fairly familiar with this beer. Actually, I guess I should rephrase that: I thought I was familiar with this beer. It had a nice hop profile and proved to be really easy drinking for being 7% ABV, although as time went on, I found it to be somewhat bottom-heavy. The initial mouthfeel was great, but the aftertaste was a bit too bitter and not as crisp as some of the IPAs I\'d had from the golden land of Californy. In the interim, I even took a trip down to San Francisco in January and overloaded on some pretty amazing IPAs and DIPAs. I came back to BC thinking that BC IPAs would never compare to the stuff I\'d had down there. For the most part, I was right. Central City IPA was a bit too malty and I had to double check the can to make sure I didn\'t pick up the ESB on accident, the hop profile being less impressive than I had remembered; Switchback IPA was better, with a nice hop profile, citrusy and piny and crisp, although it had a very familiar beta acid bitterness on the end of the aftertaste.And then I finally found a bottle of Fat Tug IPA. I approached it with apprehension. Before my trip to CA, I viewed it as a great IPA -- one of the best brewed in BC, alongside Hop Therapy (different classes, obviously). I didn\'t want to ruin that impression. As it turns out, my fears were completely misplaced, because this is an even better beer than I remembered it to be. I\'m not sure if it was just because I had a really fresh bottle (and with BCLS, it\'s really hard to tell, not to mention they don\'t refrigerate their beers) or they tweaked the recipe or what, but it surprised the hell out of me.The appearance is a somewhat hazy golden amber with a pretty great off-white head and lacing on the glass. The initial smell is a gorgeous citrusy hop smell, with some bready malts way at the back. The taste is really crisp citrus hops. As you allow the taste to permeate, you begin to notice a fairly solid malt backing that adds a great balance to the beer (something that I\'d never really noticed before). The aftertaste was surprisingly light and fairly crisp. Like I said, this was pretty astounding to me as I remember the aftertaste being a lot heavier and way more bitter but, again, I\'m not sure if it\'s just due to the fact that I had a really fresh bottle or if Driftwood tweaked their recipe any. Driftwood plz add bottling dates to your IPAs ok thanks :(Overall, I\'m really glad I revisited this beer. It used to be really good for BC IPAs, now I can say with certainty that it\'s better than most of the IPAs I\'ve had in the Pacific Northwest and maybe only a notch or so below the best (single) IPAs found in Southern California. This seems like a somewhat back-handed compliment but it really isn\'t. Trust me.Edit: as of March 2013, Driftwood has started printing bottling dates on the cap of their beers. Truly the Best Brewery.Edit: as of July, 2016, ehhh. I feel this IPA has seen better days. I feel it used to be the flagship for the BC scene, but, I feel like it\'s becoming outdated once again. I still think it\'s an enjoyable beer, from a personal point of view, but I\'ve had so much better from around BC - Juxtapose, Frank IPA from Machine Brewing, Fuggles & Warlock\'s IPAs (Cannon IPA, to start with - and not ""officially"" an IPA, but their Icarus Mosaic Saison is basically a single-hopped farmhouse IPA, and it\'s one of the best things I\'ve had in BC since Nectarous)Anyway, my point is, I\'m gonna have to re-adjust the rating for this beer a bit. It\'s still damn good, and I still go for it when I feel like a chewy IPA to graze on. But it\'s no longer my standard.Feb 08, 2013', ""Wow, excellent beer! Poured at a good temperature with a decent sized, foamy, cream-colored head that settled after a bit and some lace. Color is a clear amber with lots of tiny bubble trails. Aroma is hop, malt, caramel, wet grain. Flavor's where this really shines: similar to nose, but so much richer with just enough sweet to perfectly match the already balanced bitter and carbonic tang, plus pine resin, a little grapefruit, toast, toffee, wheat. Body and carbonation are perfect. Finish is like flavor, of average length, and super drinkable. Wish I had loads more and that we could get it here in La Crosse, Wis.Oct 26, 2012"", ""Poured from the bottle into a nonic pint glass.A very pale amber body, somewhat cloudy, but with nice orange hues, and beautiful rising carbonation. Head is three fingers deep and large with a big giant cap and off white in color. Speckled lacing peppers the glass all over.Great dry pine hop nose on this. A real nice aromatic sense of citrus orange zest hints at the back. Spritzy. Faint sweet malts too. Fantastic bouquet.Palate manages to take a back seat and let the smells do the talking. Soft palate with a somewhat juicy body. Hop angle seems dialed down a bit, but a good simple light toasty sugar malt brings up much of the flavor profile. A real nice soft body, airy in feel, with little carbonation. Hop angle seems subdued with a quick bitter, and a light aftertaste and prickly sensations.Overall the nose brings the impression of greatness, but it becomes just a good solid IPA in it's own right. Tasty!Oct 08, 2012"", ' ounce bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating but this should be pretty fresh. Pours lightly hazy golden orange color with a nice 3 finger dense off white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Thick soapy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big pineapple, mango, lemon zest, orange rind, herbal, floral, pine, grass, and earthy spiciness. Excellent aromas with great balance and hop complexity. Taste of big grapefruit, orange rind, pineapple, herbal, floral, pine, and earthy spiciness. Good amount of floral bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, pineapple, herbal, pine, floral, and earthy spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Great balance and complexity of hop flavors; with a nice bitterness/sweetness balance as well. No cloying flavors on the finish at all. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with nearly zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic IPA! Excellent hop complexity and balance; very smooth and crisp to drink. Extremely enjoyable.Oct 07, 2012', ""Another awesome bottle from Rutager in a recent trade. Thanks for the stellar box man. Much appreciated! From a bomber into a snifterBest by 13 December 2012IBU: 80 APPEARANCE: Pours a two finger, thicker looking, fluffy white head with great retention. Head slowly fades to a full wisp and coats the top of the glass. Light burnt orange in color, perfectly clear with no carbonation. A splotchy wisp remains until the close and leaves some decent lacing down the glass. Looks great. SMELL: Big nose full of pale malts, honeydew melon, pineapple, mango and tangerine aromas. Lots of tropical fruits and plenty forthcoming. Great stuff. TASTE: Follows the nose nicely. Pale malts, caramel, and lots of tropical fruits up front. Pineapple, orange and tangering through the middle, then a good dose of piney, bitter hops at the swallow. Bold and lingering aftertaste of bitter piney and floral hops, sweet melon and pineapple as balance. Lots of bitter hops linger on the palate. Very flavorful for sure, but just need a slightly fuller body for top marks. PALATE: Medium body and medium carbonation. Semi-creamy on the palate, goes down fine and finishes dry. Could be slightly creamier and fuller, but nothing wrong here. OVERALL: This was excellent and definitely lived up to expectations. Great nose and amazing flavors, though the average palate sold it short somewhat. With a creamier and fuller body, the flavors would come out a little more and you'd have a world class experience on your hands. As it is now, it's simply an amazing beer that I would love to drink in mass quantities every summer. These guys know how to brew hoppy beers. Thanks again Rutager. Top class stuff!Oct 03, 2012"", ""I have reviewed this previously on tap from the Alibi Room in Vancouver. I got hold of an incredibly fresh bottle all the way out in Fernie, BC while I was up from Montana. I must say, this beer's delicate hop character translates incredibly well into bottled form. The hop profile is very untraditional, the citrus is there, but it plays second hand to the more forward melon and mango characters. Usually I can tell what hops went into a beer, this one I am absolutely stumped. For me, it checks almost everything on the list, I have not complaints. It is a one of a kind IPA, and it is the work of brewers that clearly know what they are doing. I hope to see more brewers coming up with unique IPAs like this one.Aug 24, 2012"", 'On-tap at The Whip in Vancouver, BC.Pours a bright, coppery orange colour, with a mild, but filmy head of off-white. Patchy, sudsy, crackly lace forms as the head subsides. Strong streaming carbonation races through the solid body. Looks nice.Nose is pungent and sharp with under-ripe orange, laced with stewed fruits and butterscotch. Simcoe, my old friend? Slight mild piney greenness pokes its head in as well. It\'s OK, but it really pushed all my ""Warning! Warning! Generic American IPA Alert!"" buttons.Flavour is similar. There\'s no intrinsic sweetness to the brew, but the hops lend a caramel stewed sweetness to the mix that cloys with the big direct bitterness. The light feel on the palate means that there\'s a really pronounced hop vector slicing bitterly across the tongue. Finish is bunched and compressed, but stretched longitudinally at the back of the palate, giving a broad residual alpha bitterness.I was shocked when I saw how highly this beer is regarded on BA. This really felt like a pretty standard, if highly-hopped IPA, that didn\'t really think about the balance in its flavour profile. As far as I was concerned, this is really average stuff.Aug 05, 2012', 'thanks to egrace84 for sharing this beer!

Clings to the glass very well.Smell: Lush fruit, slight pine, some bitterness, resiny, and mango.Taste: Lots of mango here mixed with a bit of orange and low on pine. Has a bit of a sweet spot.Mouthfeel: Hops are there, bitterness is felt (mostly in aftertaste) but the malt is strong as well.Overall: An IPA that packs more flavor than bitterness but still very well done.Oct 12, 2011', ""In the immortal words of the late Randy Macho Man Savage...Oh, yeah! We have a local contender to the current heavyweight champion -- Red Racer IPA. Looks and smells like a full-bodied Northwest IPA should...in short, it's a hop bomb, but with a bit more piney presence than the aforementioned Red Racer. It's also a touch sweeter, but not in a cloying way. A delicious sessionabe IPA that cleverly hides its punchy 7% ABV. Alas, it's not easily found throughout the Lower Mainland. Too bad. Driftwood, despite being relative newbies to the BC craft beer scene, continue to brew superior and creative offerings. Kudos!Sep 29, 2011"", ' oz poured into a 16oz nonic pint. Just moved up to Victoria and seeing that this was the top beer of the Great Canadian Beer festival and it is brewed in Victoria, i figured I had to give it a try.

Clean, crisp, solid hop presence and good lingering finish. A very well done IPA.Sep 14, 2011', 'Best before: 01/04/12 - surprise by my lovely wife from her recent trip to Victoria.Pours a cloudy, orange - almost Nestea like in the way it fades at the bottom of the glass. Thin head, not much there but manages to throw some patches of lacing.Nose is sweet and tropical, hints of citrus rind and pine. West-coast influenced all the way, aromatic but not perhaps as involved and complex as some exemplars.Wonderful mix of tropical hops and bittering pine and grapefruit rind in the flavor, leaning to pine. Still a nice caramel sweet backdrop with hints of papaya and pineapple, malt is not too heavy though - lets the hops shine as the star, resiny and full of hop-burp goodness. Just a hint of alcohol in there as well, pretty smooth body, light carbonation. Great IPA, would by my go to I think - along with Red Racer. Canadian standout.Jul 27, 2011', ""Best by: 01/04/12A: pours an apricot honey ale with less than a single finger of soapy white head. This dissipates to a broken sheet of the same atop a near excellent clarity brew. Spotty lace. S: sweet biscuit malts and bubble gum and citrus hops. Best nose I've had in BC so far. T: nice bitter pinch with plenty of those bubble gum flavors and citric rinds. Just a hint of the malt comes thru this beast making it almost like a summer American ipa, but a blend of west coast and great lakes style hop scheduling. M: really thin, moderate carb and dry finish. Would like a little more body. O: probably the best ipa I've had from the few breweries I've sampled here in Victoria. They could probably sell this stateside without any trouble (on tap).Jul 19, 2011"", 'A: 1/2"" creamy white and soapy head over cloudy amber liquid.S: Citrus and pine hops and the smell of malt. Very refreshing and clean smelling.T: Front loaded with pine and bitter hops, and backloaded with a malty and nutty aftertaste.M: Medium thickness, and medium carbonation.O: Refreshing IPA,with piney and purfumey hops. Not a session beer.Jul 08, 2011', ""Bomber into a pint glass, thanks to psiweaver for the opportunity to try this generous extra via a recent trade. No freshness dating to be found and it appears to be filtered/no sediment in the bottle. This brew appears a clear color of copper with a creamy topping of 2 fingers worth of rich yellowish stained head. There is a light amount of haze keeping this brew from being perfectly clear and bubbles rise to the surface in support of the head. As the cap slowly fades, it produces patches and spots of lacework all over the glass.The aroma of this brew is bright citrus hop notes that come across with a touch of pine and resinous rindy characteristics. There is a mild catty scent that dare i say suggests a touch of stinky cheese in there as well. A touch of grassiness lingers throughout which adds some nice depth. Overall quite enjoyable. As it warms, it picks up some toasted caramel malt scents that provide a light sweetness to this brew's scent.The taste of this brew is bitter with a rindy touch that immediately draws thoughts of alcohol grapefruit juice upon my first sip. It lingers with a resinous cling inside the mouth that turns a bit catty mixed with grassy notes but maintains a bitter fruity flavor consistently. There is a very mild sweetness to this brew that is a cross between rindy fruits like grapefruit and a sweetness somewhat like a toasted type of caramel malt. This brew finishes crisp and refreshing which is interesting for something in the 7% range.There is a solid warming factor from the alcohol's inclusion, that 7% abv is felt through and through without any suppression. However, the alcohol is well integrated and enjoyable with the flavors that exist. It is medium bodied and modestly carbonated. Overall well balanced and enjoyable, I would certainly drink this again if given the opportunity.May 15, 2011"", 'shout out to rutager and thank you, 22 oz bomber split between myself and fellow BA and this review is coming from the notes...orange haze with golden shit coming through (i really wrote that wtf) i dunno. 2 fingers of off white head reduced to a layer tight bubbles. did not show great lacingA - sweet fruits up front, touch of lemony aroma, more citrus and hints of pineapple in particular. Pale malt background very subtle which is submissive to the citrusy aromas. T - The citrus is much less dominant that was present in the nose, getting a piney sap which is new, hints of orange peel dryness along with a sharp bitterness in the back, again the malts are there...barely... but push for a balance. no alcohol is present.M - light to medium body moderate carbonation, slight prickly finish O - this brew is solid and i would like to have it again, the orange peel dryness is a bit too dominant for me but that may vary from batch to batch. Nothing jumped out to me, i hate to say this because the beer is good, but this one may be just another face in the crowd.May 12, 2011', 'Another new one for the day, this was the big DIPA we were missing yesterday afternoon so we needed to find one to make a grand appearance and here we had it. Served cold and split into two pint glasses, this was consumed on 04/24/2011.What a nice pour that came out of this one. A lighter than I would have expected amber color, was almost a golden pale with loads of carbonation and a huge billowing white head that sat on top with a large amount of foam that stuck to the sides and dripped down the glass.A huge aroma then came wafting through the air. Lots of orange rind, grapefruit, and hints of lemon that layer on top of a light grain and bready base that offers a nice touch of balance but without distracting from the real gem here that was the since hop. Very light for as strong as it was, I really did not expect that at all. It was almost trying to deceive you with its full strength as the light hops and lingering dryness in the flavor left you thirsting for more, but at over 10% you were quickly reminded of its real strength.Overall a very solid DIPA. It comes with a long line of simcoe forward big ipas that have come before it but this one really works. Besides you have to love the Canadian aspect to it, overall a hit and a nice way to roll into the mid afternoon.Apr 25, 2011', 'Pours a hazy orange colour, nice fluffy white head, good lace on the glass. The nose on this is incredible, bursting with citrus, ornage, tangerine, notes of pine and a good malt back to this. Taste is mostly pine and not how the nose would lead you to believe, slight citrus, grapefruit, good hoppy bitterness, malt is there, good balance here. Medium weight, nice slick hop oil, carb a touch high, good overall feel. Good IPA overall, solid bitterness and quite enjoyable.Apr 24, 2011', 'Poured a beautiful coppery orange from bottle to oversized wineglass. An inch and a half off white head which disappeared in about a minute 30. Unfiltered? Foggy appearance.Detected scents of apricots and sweet fruits. Obvious floral bouquet of hop aromas. Very pleasing. Tasted very nice. A definite bitterness at the back of the tongue with light pine. Just right. Again, apricot and this beer really reminded me of DFH Aprihop. Malty and sweet at the tip of the tongue. Well balanced.Balanced again with a medium body. Very comfortable.A very well finished beer. More hops than malt, but balanced by the sweet fruit/apricot jam flavours that they were able to produce. All around enjoyable and highly recommended.Apr 23, 2011', ""Split a bomber with JayAre46. Thanks sonA: poured a hazy burnt orange with a finger of eggshell white foamy head. The carbonation bubbles slowly make their way through the syrup to the top.

Subtle malt and pine backgroundT: floral and pine off the bat complimented with orange peel and grapefruit. Not alot of malt to speak of... I wish the caramel scent would be more present on the paletM: medium to light bodied, alot thinner than I was expecting... Prickly carbonation attacks my taste buds with every sip.

There\'s also a little spring forest both pine and just a little spruce, zero booze and just enough malty toffee to keep the hops from having complete control T thankfully it mimics the smell quite well but with more citric rind opposed to the fruity flesh, pretty solid IPA going on here and I\'m proud of the fact this is from my preferred side of the border because it could hold its own against anything from state side M medium bodied and has a nice bitter bite without stripping the enamel off my teeth, flavors linger and the carbonation\'s just right O zero flaws and close to perfection in many areas, I could drink myself stupid with this beer without thinking twice if I only had the chance here in Albertathis really is a kick ass IPA from ""our"" West Coast, an IPA and 1/2 perhaps and oh so worth seeking out. An entire bomber went down in no time flat and if I had regular access to this I\'d be drinking it daily. If your an agent reading this DO WHAT EVER YOU CAN TO GET THIS BEER/BREWERY IN YOUR ALBERTA PORTFOLIO, if your just a geek off the street drink this every time you get the chance. Did I mention chickenm is the man for getting this bad boy into my filthy hands?Apr 16, 2011', ""Bottle sampled at Volo, poured into a flute glass.Poured a golden yellow, filtered with a great fluffy and sticky offwhite head. Webbed lacing and solid retention. Nose is big on the citrus hops, orange, tangerine, grapefruit, with some understated pineiness in there as well. Sits atop a solid caramel malt base. Great nose. Taste is quite bitter initially, more pine and less citrus than the nose suggested. Really wasn't expecting this given the nose, but was pleasant otherwise. Prickly carbonation, and good drinkability. A nice IPA, wish I could've had a bigger sample of this.Apr 06, 2011"", 'Pours slightly cloudy grapefruit with hige white foamy head that leaves lots of spider web lacing down the glass. Wafts C-hop. Tangerine and orange citrus taste, very drinkable. Not astringent but a little numbing of the tongue. Carbonation is right there, this is a very fresh bottle. A little funky in the finish, but this makes it all the more interesting.650 ml, thanks Brian, and thanks Derek for the recommendation.Apr 04, 2011', 'Pours a slightly hazy orange color with a huge lasting fluffy white head. Aroma is pleasant but somewhat subdued with malt and citrus hops. Taste is hoppy but balanced with pine, bready malt, and citrus. The body is a bit light but this has a really nice smooth mouthfeel. The carbonation is almost perfect. Another great beer from Driftwood!Mar 02, 2011', 'Step up to the top of the IPA class in BC . An IPA that delivers all the hoppy goodness that we expect but with a complex piny , grapefruity finish that is backed up with tons of malt. I found it very balanced but not shy on the hops. Central City , Phillips and Tree are all available in Government stores in 6 packs making them more accessible and easier to consume but this may be my favourite BC IPAFeb 04, 2011', 'another bottle that Viggo brought over. thanks eric!22oz bottle. sampled jan 9/2011.pours nearly clear deep gold with a big dense cream coloured head. the head drops slowly and leaves plenty of lace as it falls.aroma is great. resiny pine. grapefruit and orange. bit of tangerine. honey and caramel. bit of toffee. white bread and cracker. bit of biscuit. hint of alcohol. lightly spicy.taste is good. just over medium bitterness level. resiny pine and grapefruit. orange. bit of tangerine. slightly powdery. light alcohol. white bread and cracker. bit of biscuit. spicy and slightly earthy hop character too, a neat blend of english and american traits.mouthfeel is good. just over medium body, but with a nice dry finish. medium carbonation level.drinkability is great. nice balance. good hop depth. a tasty ipa!Feb 04, 2011', ""Nothing special about the colour, a very pale orange, but nice off white head that stook around for a while.The nose has honey and grapefruit notes, subtle pine, orange maybe vanilla.The taste is great. The label says shwack o' hops, and they are right, but at 80 IBU's they arent over the top. Creamy, well balanced, bitterness is pleasing and not overpowering. This is a good beer. Red Racer might have just gotten a little more competition.Driftwood is definately becoming a player. Recomended next time your craving a little hop.Jan 16, 2011"", 'First BA review :-)Bomber bought from Brewery Creek. Recomended by the lovely, friendly girl behind the counter after asking about the sold out Deschutes Hop Trip which I intended to buy more of. Appearance: After a somewhat (anxious?) agressive pour, light orange with beautiful off-white, two finger head which dissipates after a couple minutes. Nice lacing. Smell: Piney, grapes and lemon.Taste: Hoppy indeed!! Pine-tree sap, crisp underipe grapefruit. Slight caramel and lemon. Mouthfeel. Oily bitterness that last just long enough. Medium carbonation. Alchohol present but very well hiddenDrinkability: Went through this too fast and wished I had another!! Looks like this will be added to the regular rotation for at least the next while. Overall: First Driftwood product for me and not a moment too soon. Will be keeping my eye out for this bad boy of a hop fix. Looking forward to trying more from these guys!!Jan 07, 2011', ""A low SRM and a nice spicy hop finish from Driftwood. One of BC's up and comers and I have been enjoying what they are doing so far. I never would have guessed 7% for the ABV it drinks a little lighter than that. Maybe having a DDC Chaman first wasn't the way to go in drinking beers tonight. I would have to try again to be fair to this brew. I like what this brewery is doing and hope some day we can by their products in Alberta. The hops slightly winning the battle with malt and that is not a bad thing.Dec 18, 2010"", ""Served a bit too warm - which I'd guess brought forward the maltsweetness.Clear gold color. Good slightly off-white head; bubbles on the coarse side.Smell: citrus, piney, and spicy.Taste: Hop presence is distinctly spicy, maybe grapefruit rind, or grapefruit with orange rind. Feels a bit hot for 7%. Mouth feel: initially a little thin, but then some creamy bubblesform. Maybe too many bubbles? Swallow leaves a back-of-the-mouth oily film.This strikes me as pretty drinkabie for 7%, 80 IBUs. A little one-dimensional, but over all I like what they've done with the spicy hops. Its biggest flaw is mouthfeel: too light and foamy ( this might be the result of the serving temperature, but if not it would still be great with a burger and fries).Dec 11, 2010"", 'Yum! A little bit more tame than Sartori, but a very powerful and hoppy IPA. Orangery-copper with a white head that is very chunky and clingy. Rich, hoppy smell. There is an initial hoppy blast followed up a sweet, bready malt. Citrusy, grassy fruit flavours. Malts are not dominant at all.Good carbonation, very nice beer even in a 7% bomber.Nov 13, 2010', ""Bomber purchased from Central City liquor store. Let's see how it compares to the coveted Red Racer IPA...Appearance: Slightly orange. Poured smoothly to nice creamy head. Dissipates over time.Smell: Pungent hoppy aroma. Not so much grapefruity like other IPA's. Green, piney hops with some biscuity notes.Taste: Wow this is hoppy! Lots of grassy, piney hoppiness. Very indicative of a well balanced west coast IPA. Reminds me of Phillips Hop Circle and LaConner IPA. Mouthfeel: Fat Tug definitely is a showcase for the IBU. All 80 (according to the bottle) come through strongly and boldly. Carbonation is spot on. Slight malty sweetness contrasts beautifully with the bitterness.Drinkability: If this were available in 6-packs, it'd be dangerous stuff. The alc/vol is high yet subtle in the taste. And the bitterness keeps it interesting.Overall: Another GREAT beer from Driftwood and yet another sign of the amazing BC craft beer scene. Tons of hops, and different enough from Red Racer to make it stand out on it's own as one of the great West Coast IPA's. PS. Apologies to Driftwood for the constant comparison to Central City(however it's inevitable these days with Red Racer's reputation). Driftwood is truly an innovator and leader in the BC craft beer movement. This, along with their Sartori, definitely solidifies them as one of BC's best brewers.Nov 10, 2010"", 'I finally tried one of these today, and it is definitely my favourite IPA of all those I can remember by name, and equal to an excellent one I remember having at an American micro-brew pub (in Long Beach; Rock Bottom brewery perhaps). By far better than the IPAs from other local micro breweries which I have always found underwhelming - one is too malty, the other not carbonated enough for my liking.The taste is very strong hops, with an amazing bitterness, and a delicious citrus-cannabis-bergamot aftertaste. No heavy malty flavours or anything to distract from this delicious hoppiness, and the hops taste fresh and, despite being very powerful, delicate. Nice carbonation; not too strong but not weak and syrupy either.Three thumbs up.Nov 09, 2010', ""The much anticipated IPA from Driftwood...A: Clear gold with a white head, great retention and lacing.S: Huge, perfumy aroma. Plenty of tangerine and grapefruit rind, floral, pine and a little cattiness.T: Pine, grapefruit rind, nectarine, tangerine, assertive bitterness, candied pineapple, sponge toffee, mild alcohol, great stuff!M: Moderate body is smooth, with a modest carbonation and a light hop acidity.D: If you're a hop head and think 7% isn't sessionable, THINK AGAIN!This is right up there with Red Racer... a hop lovers dream. I'm not sure if there's quite as much finishing (aroma) hops, but there's plenty of flavour and a bit more bitterness. An all-around great brew!Nov 08, 2010"", ""I grabbed this at the local liquor store, only to realize it was just bottled today! You can't get much fresher than that, perfect for an IPA. The beer pours an ever so slightly hazy yellowy copper with a nice foamy head that lingers. The aroma is like sticking your nose into a handful of fresh hop cones, resiny pine, citrus, pungent grassiness and bitter earthiness all meld together, with a nice background of malty sweetness. The freshness really shows, it smells like it finished dry hopping today!Bitterness punches strongly upfront with plenty of citrus and piney hop flavor. More earthy, and harsh grassiness in the flavor. The finish is bitter and almost pungently sour. The malt is there, but it is well hidden, it only pops up here and there.I look forward to seeing the beer on draft around Victoria, it is the most brutal IPA I've had from the Island.Oct 25, 2010""]",https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/18858/62911/

I'm not quite sure what those secondary flavors are (malts or something), but it's really cool and complimentary. After enough sips, one can't notice this anymore because the hops takes over the tongue.Overall verdict: If you love hops and love IPAs then you should totally love this!

I had 2 cans on separate occasions and in my opinion it is pretty standard.

This bottle was delivered by a friend who's a flight attendant, directly off the plane. Super!Appearance: Light orange to amber with hints of brown, all under a snow white foam, which leaves a slight amount of lacing on the glass.Aroma: Lots and lots of melon, grapefruit, other tropical fruits, your typical C-hops aroma, and some crystal malt sweetness and then, a little alcoholic feel in the nose.Flavor:Front: The first flavor is citrus, melon, a decent amount of bitterness, a little tartness and some sweetness behind all that.Mid: More citrus, melon, grapefruit, and again, a decent bitterness, heavy but not overpowering here. Again, a little tartness but on the side it’s both bitter and a crystal malt sweetness is quite strong, which is good, making it a nice balanced IPA. Back: Lots more citrus and tropical fruit, and here we can feel a large sweet wave of crystal and pale malts to balance out the bitterness, which actually comes across quite mild. You get a very nice dose of caramel here, more than your average IPA… are they using Münchner malt?Aftertaste: Bitterness, sweet caramel and tartness with a shot of citrus.Mouthfeel: Not bad, not quite thick enough for my taste, but still not thin and weak. It’s almost süffig.Overall: For a “West Coast IPA,” very very good, almost great. It’s not Heady Topper or Pliny the Younger, but what is? It’s still a excellent IPA.

The problem: many Canadian liquor stores have ordered these in bulk, not realizing that IPA's tend to have a best before date. A swift look beneath the can will reveal the bottling (canning) date.

One of the best BC has to offer.Apr 19, 2014"", 'Highly touted beers don\'t often live up to their hype, so Bucky was a little wary when he bought a can of Red Racer India Pale Ale (""RRIPA"") at his local LCBO. RRIPA came in a 355 ml can, with a beautiful 1950\'s style cartoon of a pretty redhead riding a bike. I\'ll have to add a bit to this beer\'s rating just for the visuals on the can...probably the coolest I\'ve seen to date! The bottom of the can was stamped with an April 27, 2012 production date and an August 25, 2012 ""best before"" date...a nice touch in providing both pieces of information, and the first time I can recall being given both. RRIPA was 6.5% alcohol by volume. RRIPA is produced by Central City Brewing Company, which was named the Best Brewery in Canada at the 2010 Canadian Brewing Awards. The brewery is located at 13450 - 102nd Avenue in Surrey, BC, with RRIPA being by far its best seller. Central City began its life as a brewpub, but subsequently added a canning and bottling line. The beer poured a slightly hazy, orange/gold colour, with the orange hues becoming more noticeable when backlit. An aggressive pour produced about 1/2"" of off-white, lightly orange tinged head which dissipated to a thin collar after 3 minutes, leaving a surprising amount of lacing down the glass given the collar\'s small size. The aroma from the can was an intensive combination of tropical fruits, dominated by grapefruit, but with discernable notes of pine, pineapple and tangerine. A wonderful aroma, but it left me with the distinct impression that I was about to consume a serious hop bomb. The beer\'s flavour began with bitter grapefruit, giving way to a slightly sweet combination of pine with hints of pineapple and tangerine. RRIPA finished with a distinct bitterness, which seemed to become more noticeable as the beer warmed. The bitterness continued as a long lasting aftertaste...too long lasting given my dislike of lingering aftertastes generally, and bitter ones specifically. Ideally, RRIPA could use a bit more caramel malt to better balance its bitterness...but otherwise, a solid IPA. I would describe RRIPA as medium bodied, with its 6.5% alcohol contenting helping to heft it up a bit. The level of carbonation is modest, but well suited to the brew. At $2.55 per 355 ml can, I\'d consider RRIPA to be a bit on the pricey side, but worth the occasional splurge.Apr 17, 2014', ""appearance:amber,orange, not entirely clear. pours with some gravity, lands into one finger of solid foampoured it a couple min ago , to let it settle in, and its head is still foamy and not dissipating, this is one of the longest staying heads ive seen.. lacing is thick and leaves rings for each drink. smell:immediate note of cascade hops, followed by some sweet grapefruit, and a brightyeasty note like home made bread with citrus jelly. very sweet nose. amazing brightness , the smell is strong and immediate, citrus cascades.taste:other reviews Ive read have said the bitterness was the most forward part of this beer's taste, for me , its bright resinous hops, a burst of sharp dank hopsfollowed by the citrus flavour so obvious from the nose, then it levels down tothe bitter flavour, but its sweet into the aftertaste, complex, but not overdone.it has a heavy almost orange peel flavour from the resins in the fresh hops.the cascade hops are very present throughout. but balanced well by some other hops,which they didnt mention on the can.mouth:surprisingly flat and easy drinking for the level of hops used, and the slightly higher ABv, it starts off a bit foamy and levels down to a bitteralmost dry sort of aftertaste which lingers for a long time, fives of minutes even.overall:I generally avoid the whole range of IPA, as its not a style I've enjoyed often.but hearing such high reviews of this ale I picked one up, and I had decided thateven if it isnt my preferred style, something scoring so highly must be worth trying,I am still not a huge fan of this style of beer, but I am glad to have bought this one.as its sort of redefining how I thought this style could be presented.

I found a six-pack at a Superstore liquor outlet of all places. Maybe a holy grail type mindset will bias this review, but regardless here goes. Pours a really nice burnished orange-amber color, with the copper liquid giving way to epic quantities of pale foam if you are patient and avoid a sissy pour down the sides, and I recommend this as the aroma is something to behold. Strong grapefruit and mango meld with brown sugar and pepper, and a taste echoes these elements and then some. I get these aromas on the palate, along with a musky tropical note like guava, a bittersweet component that recalls licorice, orange breakfast crystals, and a dank weediness like so-called BC bud. An amazing amount of flower shop perfume. Add some camphor and pine elements (catty?) and a bit of a musty currant vibe and you get a pretty amazing complexity that renders this beer's accolades just. The finish is classic bitterness but not hop bomb rank ... I enjoy the latter approach in imperial IPAs but here see the refined finish as a positive. The bitter builds a bit as you go but does plateau and the sweetness of the malts remains firmly by its side. A nigh perfectly balanced treat that strikes English malt and American hop notes simultaneously, without causing the Revolutionary War. They brew this in Surrey? I suppose the holy grail is going to be found in the remote inhospitable jungle, not on an idyllic beach.Edit: I am happy with this review but figured I'd mention that this one is getting easier to find.

Rich gold with pinkish highlights, it doesn't have the richness of colour that many IPAs do, almost as if its been a little over-filtered. The smell is sharp piney hops backed with sweet floral malts, and not overly strong -- an aroma that leads one to expect an IPA on the light, refreshing side, rather than a fuller, more mouth-filling example of the style. And that's exactly what we get: a quintessential summer IPA, nicely balancing an almost British malt profile (think Deuchars IPA) with west-coast hops, while not going overboard on either. In the finish, though, the hops take over, their grapefruit-pith bitterness lingering after any hint of sweet has vanished. Overall, while there's a lot of flavour here, its lightness both keeps it almost sessionable and (less positively) prevents it from reaching the highest heights of the style.Jun 23, 2013"", 'A - pours a perfectly clear light orange copper.

I love to try new stuff, and this is hard to resist.It pours a brilliant orange colour - a little more attractive than some other IPAs I've had - which is a tall order. The aroma is rich in grapefruit and hops. Grapefruit is a natural pairing for beer, and whether or not some was added to the beer, it's extremely palatable. The taste is powerfully hoppy, which seriously makes me wonder how hoppy their imperial IPA must be. Pity we can't get it in. There is a ton of texture on my tongue, and the aftertaste is strong and citrusy. This is really a beer for hop heads. I love me an IPA and even I find this a wee bit strong.

There\'s a pretty massive bitterness, but the mouthfeel is smooth and the finish is pretty sweet. If you want some hops, this\'ll do it for you. A lot of the grassy and piney notes without much citrus, so go with this if you want a beer along those lines. Incredibly balanced, insanely drinkable, fantastic tasting.

It's a mighty fine looking beer, crisp and not cloudy.Smell: Piney hop aromas with a certain sweetness to it. The smell makes you want to drink it.Taste: Wonderful hoppy character with a sweet delicious malt backbone. It's piney with a resinous after taste but finishes clean on the pallette. The carbonation level gives it a nice bite and the mouthfeel is pleasantly on the oily side.Overall: Wow, what a great beer. I wish I had bought more than just the single can for this review. What really shines is the clean finish and the hops to malt balance.

Pleasantly bitter flavours of pine, grapefruit overlaid on caramel malt. Nicely evenhanded, 6.5% alcohol fits in well and doesn't distract. Lingering bitter finish. A treat to drink.Flavour rules!

Two finger egg shell head retains well and laces very nicely.S: Blend of sweet caramel malts, resiny pine, and light citrus fruits. Not the in your face aroma I was expecting as it is a bit subdued.T: Right off the bat your hit with a combo of fresh resinous, sprucey pine (think Christmas tree) and a smack of tropical citrus and grapefruit. Hops are pretty dominant but there is a bit of caramel malt sweetness to offset the bitterness and they work well off each other. Dry, lingering hop finish, very clean.M: Medium bodied, smooth carbonation, very easily drinkable.O: Blends fresh pine, citrus, and malty sweetness together nicely. The nose was a bit of a let down, but besides that, its a very solid IPA. Would like to know exactly how old the can was and will look for this in the future to compare. Having this super fresh would probably be amazing.Nov 16, 2012', ""Appearance: Slightly hazy caramel/tan hue with a thin soapy off-white head.Aroma: Grapefruit juice with a little orange. Some caramel/crystal malt in the background to fill it out a little more. Like a Midwest IPA.Taste: Lots of flavorful bitterness throughout and it lingers quite nicely. Pine/grapefruit/citrus hop profiles, in that order. Not too heavy on the malt which is good. The intense bitterness tends to override the actual flavor at times but that's not exactly uncalled in this one. The finish is dry and the lingering bitterness attaches itself to your palate. There are moments when I taste more depth that lead me to believe a fresh can would really show off how good this beer could be. Pretty robust for 6.5% ABV but not a huge surprise with the amount of hops that must be in this.Mouthfeel: Near tongue splitting bitterness at first but the palate is quick to adjust. Medium bodied with average drinkability.Final Thoughts: As an appetizer this beer would be a wise choice. Lots of bitterness and good flavor. Would I drink it again?

From a 355ml can into a snifterAPPEARANCE: Pours a two finger, medium looking, fluffy, off-white head with good retention. Head fades slowly to a splotchy wisp and ring. Clear burnt orange in color with a few floaties and no carbonation evident. A splotchy wisp remains leaving some dots of lacing down the glass. Same as their ESB really. SMELL: Lots of pale malts, caramel and honeydew melon, with nice notes of grapefruit. Very nice citrus aromas and bold enough as well. TASE: Pale malts, caramel malts, with lots of bitter floral hops and pine notes at the swallow. Bold and lingering finish with lots of bitter floral hops and pine flavors, then just a hint of caramel sweetness as balance. Nice stuff, though the flavor is a little more one dimensional than the nose. Caramel and floral, piney hops. PALATE: Lighter body and higher levels of carbonation. Light on the palate, too light really, a bit airy going down, and finishes a touch dry on the palate. Too light and carbonated for the style. Same as their ESB, though a touch oilier perhaps. OVERALL: The palate is a little too weak in my book and the hop profile is not exactly my style, but I can see how this one gets so much praise, as it is definitely a well-made beer. For my tastes, I'll take Nickelbrook's Headstock IPA while at home, but it doesn't surprise me that this one is so popular. Worth checking out for sure.

Thick off-white head shows decent retention but little lace. Big aromatic notes of mango, ripe juicy peaches, and flowers. The aroma is just outrageous. If this were a perfume, I'd give it to my girlfriend on her birthday. Bold juicy mango and toasted grain flavours to start, transitioning to white grapefruit before finishing with firm pithy bitterness. Just malty enough for you to notice something other than the hops. Lingering evergreen aftertaste. Just short of medium-bodied with low carbonation. Feels smooth and light. Oily, resinous sensation left on the palate between mouthfuls. A very, very tasty IPA.

Very good complexity with a general sense of togetherness.(4.5) T: A very nicely proportioned hop/malt element to this.

Pours a hazy golden color with a huge creamy orange-white head that lingered and left incredible lacing throughout. The aroma was tangy and sweetish with moderate pine, resin and faint pineapple. The flavor was tangy pine, resin, malty, and sour caramel. There were faint undertones of grapefruit and pineapple. The finish was long and tangy with lingering caramel and pine. Moderate mouthfeel and good carbonation throughout. A very nice IPA!May 16, 2012', 'Poured into an imperial pint glass. Had a generous 3 finger frothy head that lingered for a bit, and left off white lacings on the glass. Beer was a slightly darker golden amber with plenty of carbonation rising from the bottom. Smell started off slightly herby and then shifted to an orangey citrus aroma. Small hints of sweet and flowers rounded it out. Flavor started off with plenty of hops, but then shifted to a slightly offputting acidic flavor before changing back to a bit more of bitterness from the hops. Felt strange in the mouth, almost dried out the inside which was a unique feeling to have immediately after consuming a liquid. Overall not a bad IPA, but the strange taste in the middle coupled with the funny mouthfeel took it down a bit.May 10, 2012', ""5ml can poured into a 16oz pint glass.A - Pours a vibrant amber glow with moderate haze in the body, and a frothy, cream head that clings to the glass as it dissipates after the initial pour. The lacing isn't quite what I expected, but there's certainly some sticky foam coating the glass as this one goes down.S - A salvo of tropical fruit hops upfront. Pineapple, mango, sweet oranges, passion fruit, grapefruit and just a touch of cucumber. Sweet caramel malt backbone that compliments the hop profile beautifully. This is everything I want to smell in an IPA. So good.T - Fruity hops abound in this one. All the fruits from the aroma are here in spades, with juicy pineapple and mango notes upfront, bittering grapefruit and pine, and subtle passion fruit. Malty undertones are just right, giving just the right balance but still showcasing the hop profile perfectly. As much as I know cucumber isn't really a traditional Pacific NW flavor in an IPA, it's undeniably here and works flawlessly with the other flavors. Aftertaste leaves moderate bitterness, with just the right amount of bite. Overall, this is stupidly easy to drink, and I can't picture it being any better.M - The 6.5% ABV shows up here in the body, helping thicken it up just enough. Medium bodied feel with low carbonation that just prickles the tongue. I will admit, it's slightly oily and could use a touch more carbonation; and I do also get some subtle heat from the aforementioned alcohol content. Really, this is the only weak point of this beer, and even then it's way above average. D - I really can't ask for a better beer here. This IPA packs everything I want in the style into readily available 6-packs for a more than reasonable price tag. Crafted remarkably in all departments, resulting in an IPA so drinkable that I finished drinking it before I finished the review. I was slightly skeptical this brew would live up to the hype, but it blew my expectations out of the water.

Leaves a nice bitter and citrusy aftertaste.Mouthfeel - Light-to-Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. A touch of fluffiness to the feel. Very refreshing on the palate.Overall - A great, well-crafted IPA by Central City Brewing. There are some wonderful aromas and the taste remains true to the IPA style. Definitely a must try.Apr 08, 2012', ""Appearance: Didn't produce more then a layer of bubbles, but somehow managed to still leave good lacing. The body boasts high carbonation to go with it's slightly cloudy orange colour.Smell: A powerful floral and citrus aroma on this one as the hops make their obvious appearance, with notes of pine. Didn't need any warming, although no noticeable malt and I know it's going to be too hoppy for my tastes.Taste: Hey, this one's a lot better then I'd thought it would be. It starts with a caramel malt that has only the barest herbal and floral hop notes that builds slightly and then gets annihilated by the explosion of citrus, pine and earthy hops that disagree with me and grow harsher as the beer progresses.Mouthfeel: I'd have liked a slower buildup to the hop annihilation. However the carbonation is good at holding it in check. Still, the hop oil doesn't know when it's overstayed it's welcome and it seems the nicer herbal and floral hops are drowned out by the pine and earthy ones. It also seems to get harsher and harsher the closer to the bottom you get.Drinkability: It was doing so well up until about the 1/4 mark, at which point my stomach seemed to reject it, which is a shame. The carbonation was good, but I just don't see myself wanting to put this back with anything but maybe some really spicy food.Final Thoughts: Well Red Racer, you have fared far better then most IPAs do, so take that in stride.

Seem to be butter flavors too as it warms.M: High carbonation (maybe cuz head was small), pretty creamy, with a lightish oil viscosity, medium bodied. Abv isnt surprising.O: Definitely a solid IPA, at one month old it smells fantastic, could look better but can pours are unreliable. Price point was high so I was expecting something unique, its good, but rather simple straightforward. For ABV big flavors.

The hop character of this beer is extraordinary, very citrusy and some nice complex piney notes mixing with other fruity characters.

The alcohol is nearly undetectable, despite being 6.5%. M: mouthfeel is fairly thin - which pairs well with the bold smell and flavour, too long on the tongue and this would overwhelm the tastebud with bitter. D: I find this beer best drank with a meal, particularly something spicy and capable to balance out the bitter. I choose to match this with Pad Thai, the earthiness of the peanut sauce, heat from the chilies, hits of sweet of the tamarid and pineapple play off the bitter hops.

Can with a date code of F0711, which I think is June 7th, 2011.Pours a cloudy golden with slight orange-ish hue to it. A vigorous pour yields a solid inch plus of pillowy white head, a small amount lacing is left behind. I\'m greeted by a the familiar aromas of pine and citrus... but there is something else there behind the hops but in front of the hint of sweet malty-ness is an off smell... I cannot place it, somewhere between medicinal and cleaning supplies. I still enjoy the aroma, but this unknown element has thrown me for a loop.A burst of piney resin! Somehow it is full of piney hops but isn\'t all that bitter. After the deluge of pine, a bit of citrus makes a brief cameo followed by a uncredited role by a slightly sweet malty-ness. Surprisingly the hops don\'t destroy your tongue, it is very smooth for a such a hop forward IPA. The carbonation is good, slightly low, but not enough to be detracting.A very good IPA. Nothing amazing, just a well balanced ""west coast"" style IPA from the Canuck land.Nov 18, 2011', ""Can to tulip at about 50 degrees. No can date on this one but this is from a fresh batch as it just hit shelves.Woah I cracked the can and the beer came billowing out the top all over my table...wtf!A: Finally after it subsided was able to get a nice easy pour down the center of the glass that created a finger and half of very nice head. Looks like this will have some really nice lacing. This beer is a nice apricot color, very murky when held to light. 4.0S: Smell is of really nice fresh hops tons of citrus and a bit of pine with a touch of alcohol. A nice nose on this beer. 4.0T: Taste is somewhat muted and not what I had expected from the wonderful nose. Hops are definitely there but something is lacking. Getting somewhat of an underlying green tea flavor. This is definitely enjoyable but doesn't keep up with the best of the best IPA's 4.0M: Mouthfeel is ok, definitely lacking a bit, somewhat under carbonated which is surprising considering it pretty much exploded upon opening. I suppose the carbonation left the beer at that point. Missing that oily hop presence as well. 3.0O: Overall this is not a bad IPA however the mouthfeel and light carbonation could be improved. Still a 4.0 overall.Nov 17, 2011"", '2 oz. can poured into Duvel tulip glass. Packaged on June 23, 2011.

Delicious.Nov 14, 2011', '5ml can.A - Copper body, with a nice fluffy beige head. Good head retention and some lacing. Nice.S - The moment I smelled the beer, I thought ""Passion fruit!"" Indeed, this beer gives out a very tropical fruit like smell, with hints of citrus and caramel. Very appealing!T - Wow, this is pretty hardcore! It kicks off with a solid citrus hop punch, which then transforms into a more tropical taste, with hints of passion fruit, mango and peach. Some bready toasted malts in the background. Fairly sweet. Lots of hop oil characteristics, some light astringency. Interestingly enough, the hoppiness is so intense that it lingers on up until the after-taste, in both flavour and bitterness.M - Medium body and medium level of carbonation. That being sad, this is no ordinary IPA. It\'s super bitter, fairly dry and if you\'re not used to high IBU\'s you might even find this a bit challenging to drink. However, if you are a hop-head, I\'m certain you\'ll enjoy it!O - I\'m really glad to finally try this beer. Another great IPA to come out of Canada. Definitely not a beer for everyone and, perhaps, not a session beer, BUT this is still amazing; the depth of its hoppiness makes up for everything else.Nov 12, 2011', ""Poured from a 355ml can into a nonic.Thanks to my boss for bringing this back from BC for me - I haven't had it since Mondial earlier this year. I love this beer enough to use it for my first review...A beautiful frothy head sits atop the clear coppery liquid. Everlasting lace runs down the glass as I delve into the pint. Fine beads of carbonation escape rapidly as I admire its presentation.The aroma is racy, alright - quite strong and seductive to a hophead. Grapefruit is predominant but tropical fruit notes consistently waft from the glass. There is plenty of pineapple and mango here, sweet aromas with a trace of pungency and a light pine element. It's hard not to enjoy this...Grapefruit carries the day from a tasting perspective. Juicy hop fruitiness is the primary flavour and a clean yet pithy bitterness follows in the finish. Exceptionally balanced for the style. Hops are the focus but there is so much more to savour. There is a very slight hint of sweet caramel malt , but it is well integrated and plays second fiddle to a dry breadiness. This is incredibly full flavoured and it's very hard for me to not drain the glass immediately; it tastes that pleasant.Weighing in at 6.5% ABV and laced with hops, there's no doubt that this may be full bodied for some. As an individual who enjoys strong ales, however, I found this to be quite sessionable. The mouthfeel was right up my alley - not too slick, not too watery, and the alcohol is completely imperceptible. Its certainly luscious, though.Hands down, this is the best Canadian IPA I've ever had. I've tried Stone, DFH 60 Minute, Sculpin et cetera and it is certainly in the same league as those venerable beers. My inclination is to give it a perfect score, but since I have no access to American micros to calibrate my tastebuds for this style I'll be slightly more restrained and conservative in my grading.Congratulations to Central City for crafting such a fine beer - Red Racer IPA would be my everyday choice if it was ever available in Newfoundland.Nov 11, 2011"", 'Reviewed from notes taken while trying to figure out beer pairs for a beer dinner co-hosted with jlindros.A - Poured into a tulip a slightly hazy orange colour with a silky one finger head that leaves a creamy blanket and nice modest side lacing.S - Very light hop aromas, very subtle. The pine and grapefruit are there, but very light.T - This is a bit rough. The can was clearly past its prime. The hops are there (pine and citrus) but its clearly older and drasticly faded.M - Mouthfeel was still nice, its a creamier mouthfeel. Not too sharp, but bitter.O - Overall, this clearly at one point was a good beer, unfortunately it just wasnt by the time it got to my lips. Would give it another try though.Nov 08, 2011', 'This beer was my first love when it comes to IPAs, and it still is to this day. It will always hold a special place in my beer-drinking heart, and if you find some Red Racer IPA and are wondering if you should try it, DO IT - you will not be disappointed.Nov 06, 2011', ""Picked up a Four pack in Seattle.12oz can poured into a Pint glass.A - Pours a hazy, medium orange with a two finger yellow-cream colored head.

A big bitter bite, but it is welcome here. Creamy feel.O - Great ipa, O' Canada.Nov 04, 2011"", '55 mL can picked up at the LCBO. Pours a light orange-amber colour, topped with more than two fingers of fluffy, uneven off-white head that takes its sweet time before fading away to a soapy cap. Webs of lacing stick to the side of the glass. As I noted above, this stuff has an amazing aroma - juicy grapefruit, orange rind and mango are dominant, along with some floral notes. Very hard to detect much malt character underneath the wallop of hops, but what is there is vaguely sweet/caramel-like.The flavour follows the nose for the most part - tons of juicy fruit notes... grapefruit is the most prominent but I am also reminded of oranges, pineapple, mango and pine sap. A backbone of doughy, biscuity caramel malts buried underneath the hops provides good balance, but rest assured this is still a hoppy, bitter brew. Some grapefruit rind bitterness and pine resin lingers in the aftertaste. Medium-bodied (leaning toward the light side), with middling carbonation levels to provide a good bite. High drinkability - I\'m sure you could throw this back quickly, but why would you want to waste all that flavour?[Updated Jan 19 2016]Another single can picked up at the LCBO, this time compared side-by-side with Lake Effect, Lone Pine and Fat Tug. This is still one of the best Canadian-made IPAs I\'ve tried so far, but the upper-tier local (Ontario) competition has pretty much caught up at this point. Red Racer earns extra points for being available year-round and almost everywhere, while the very reasonable price tag ensures that I will continue to return to this reliable staple. Always recommended to hopheads.[Updated Jul 8 2019]500 mL ""tallgirl"" can from the LCBO; dated May 23 2019. Red Racer\'s was one of the first quality IPAs I had the chance to review years back, and the very high grade I originally awarded it reflected my lack of experience at the time. In other words, I think I overrated it, and I\'m revising the review so that it\'s being rated more in line with the other 160-odd IPAs I\'ve had in the intervening 8 and a half years. Truthfully, this remains a solid West Coast-style IPA, and while it has gone up in price over the years I\'d still say it\'s good value. I used to buy it on a weekly basis, but the ubiquity of quality IPAs these days has really reduced the frequency with which I return to this beer.Final Grade: 4.2, an A-Nov 03, 2011', 'a-pours a nice orangy amber with a nice head.s-Piney...citrus notes...very slight maltiness.t-Dominated by hops...almost no malts coming through.

Now I enjoy Dale's Pale Ale. It's a great IPA, and a wonderful canned beer. However, I find it a little thick at times.Red Racer IPA, however, packs all the tongue-biting, mouth-watering hop characters of a beer like Dale's, but lightens the mouthfeel just enough to let me enough a few more cans.Fruity and floral upfront, I was expecting a juicier IPA, like what Avery serves up. But after a quick sip, the pineapple quickly turned to a harsh (but balanced) pine and grapefruit rind from the other end of the hops spectrum.I'm not easily impressed by IPAs, but this is a damn good example of the style. Thank you Canada.Oct 25, 2011"", 'Walked into the LCBO tonight and there was a full case sitting where some other shite usually sits. Grabbed an armful for fear it was a mirage and ran home and put one in the freezer and the rest in my beer fridge. Poured a one finger white head upon a beautiful orange amber body, lots of great lacing. The smell bursts out of the can, orange rind, grapefruit, pine resin. The taste follows the nose with a nice malt backbone balancing out the hops explosion. Mango and papaya notes. Medium bodied with some carbonation. Bitter but not overly so. Smooth and very sessionable even at 6.4%. Spectacular.Oct 19, 2011', ""00th review! Thanks to all on BA for being such a great community in which to explore beer. Reviewing and learning about brewing has turned it from a personal interest into a life long passion.

Top 3 in Canada - worth cracking open for number 500!Poured into a tulip. Bright marmalade orange in colour, with a big fluffy head possessing spectacular retention. Great circlets of lace cover the sides of the glass. Terrific looking stuff.Nose is sweet, malty, and with a delightful citrus and tropical hop kick. Peach, orange, grapefruit, mango.Opens with caramel and tropical fruit, with mango, orange and peach, before the hops clean things up with a crisp bitterness accentuated with notes of tobacco and smoke. Hop bitterness lingers for a touch after each sip. While not a true hop bomb, Central City has opted for balance and diversity of flavor, and the result has paid off nicely.Medum bodied, touch of creaminess, assertive carbonation bite.Definitely a top class IPA, and well-worth the hype. This is exactly the kind of IPA I like - though it most definitely provides that essential stiff hoppy jolt, it paints the rest of its picture with many different colours, making for a diverse and enjoyable sipper. Or I could slam several of them in a row straight out the can. Both options are there, which is something I really prize in a brew. Great stuff, and I couldn't be happier with the choice for a milestone review!Oct 19, 2011"", '2 ounce can poured into a pint glass.

Very complex nose that boasts the hops, citrus, and maltiness all at once. You can pick out all the scents so distinctly. Very hoppy, yet bitter and malt-forward taste. The way the citrus fades quickly into the malt profile is very interesting and different. This has a bit of lingering staying power as the bitterness hangs out on the back of your tongue for a good long while. Takes a swallow with an empty mouth to completely expunge the taste. Overall, this is a very pleasant surprise indeed. Great job by the folks north of the boarder.Sep 15, 2011', 'Pours a lovely bright, hazy orange amber with a finely bubble light orange head that shows beautiful retention and leaves thick lace. Lovely aroma of perfumey fruit (blood oranges, passionfruit) and pine. Juicy hoppy palate, loads of citrus rind and a minty eucalyptus herbal finish. so flavourful and drinkable.

Contrary to what most reviews picked up on the nose I smelled mostly floral,grass and pine hops with a follow of citrus. The tast pretty much follows suite but reverses roles, tart grapefruit, floral notes, and pine. The mouthfeel is there its got a medium body to it with good carbonation and a hope bite that lasts.

Sense of wetness and clean.A mix of English and American feel for hop potential. Mild grapefrut and light malt with a juicy booming texture. It is a little resin feel on the palate and teeth after the swallow. Tolerable and tight in feel almost, with a lingering hop bitter with mild astringency.This is a real solid ipa while not looking that spectacular.

The pillowy head has incredible retention and utterly coats the glass in lace. Pure PacNW hops fill my nostrils on the first sniff. More nuanced cookie dough malt aromas quickly follow making for a very pleasant nose. The taste is replete with yummy hop flavors - grapefruit, pine, melon, mango (?), floral notes... very complex. Equally impressive is the malt profile, very fresh and seamlessly integrated with the hop barrage. The mouthfeel is perfectly carbonated with velvety tiny bubbles. The finish is everything the beer is, bitter, complex, contemplative, and it lasts for ever.This the best Canadian IPA I have yet tried. This can go toe to toe with the great West Coast IPAs (e.g. Hop Ottin, Green Flash IPA, Stone IPA).

Yes sir, plenty in this one. Notes of pine and citrus like orange and grapefruit. This beer belongs on an island or in a forest.

Creamy, fluffy medium body pops with a bit of crispness. Hops jump on the taste buds like white on rice, and they are quite aggressive as well, with a high-reaching bitterness and citric rind flavor that gets right to the point. Peach and passionfruit ripeness with some dry toasted maltiness. Bitterness and hop flavor keeps on raking the palate far into the aftertaste.

Oily pine and hops comes around midway through and there is a slight malty backbone. Finishes with a slight spicy characteristic.Mouthfeel – Medium bodied, good carbonation, a slight slick oily mouthfeel.Overall – Wow, I will be purchasing more of this. A damn good and quaffable IPA that is extremely balanced, shows no alcohol, and tastes fantastic. I picked up a single of this and am glad I did. I can’t put my finger on it – it IS somewhat malty (but not really), yet quite hoppy. But the malty/caramel backbone doesn’t overtake it or kind of rush in at the tail end like some D/IPA’s...it is just, as stated, balanced. Anyway, a beer definitely worth a try if you run across it. Will for sure buy more in the future. And at $10 a sixer, you can’t complain getting 72 ounces for less than a bomber of Dreadnaught. I have found my go-to IPA now that I am back home in the Midwest and PtE is out of reach.Jun 28, 2011', 'Pours a deep amber color with a one finger off white head which fades to leave a small disc of foam. The aroma is fantastic. Smells like pineapple, grapefruit, and oranges.This beer tastes just like it smells, which is really outstanding. Some sweetness, but bitterness rules the day, and is appreciated greatly by me. Medium plus bodied, somewhat creamy, easy to drink. A truly outstanding IPA, which I am glad I had a chance to try, while staying in Vancouver.Jun 28, 2011', 'Appearance: 12 oz can. Pours a light amber with a soapy white head and a good amount of lace. Good clarity.Smell: Bright aroma of orange marmalade, caramel malts, grapefruit. Christmas tree. Absolutely beautiful.Taste: Solid pine upfront, very fresh tasting. Sappy, alittle grapefruit. Stinging bite. Hop oils coating the palate. Caramel malt backing and fairly bitter.Mouthfeel: Light to medium bodied, carbonation is perfect, finishes bitter and alittle dry.Overall: Quite impressed. Kickass IPAs in Cans from Canada do happen apparently. I definately want more of this.Jun 19, 2011', 'Pours out a light amber color into a snifter. Half a finger of head that leaves decent lacing. Smell is big, bright grapefruit citrus. Taste is more bitter grapefruit citrus and a slight pine flavor mixed with a slight roasted grain taste that seems to perfectly complement the hops. If you like grapefruit hop flavor, this is the beer for you.Mouthfeel is reasonably dry with a good amount of substance from the roasted malt. Moderate carbonation. One of the more intense grapefruit hop flavors I have gotten from a beer ever. Really nice hop flavor with a roasted grain profile that works well. A surprisingly amazing IPA. I had samples of FW Double Jack and Port Mongo before this and Red Racer stood out as the best and most flavorful.Jun 18, 2011', '/4 inch big bubbled foamy off white head with clear amber body.Huge fresh hop aromas in this.

Tropical notes hit here too, i get pineapple.Hop spice followed by a caramel malt with the citrus finishing big with hops that linger to bitter close. Very smooth mouthfeel light side of medium.

Lots of taste packed in that can.Jun 16, 2011', 'A: 1/2"" of soapy cream coloured head that dissipated over about 2 minutes. The beer itself is amber coloured with excellent clarity.S: Floral hops, pine hops.T: Bitter and powerful floral hop taste that hits you immediately then quickly disappears to leave a slightly boozy and smooth finish. Very clean tasting.M: Medium carbonation with a soapy feel to it.O: The word that comes to my mind is ""interesting"". Compared to other IPAs I have had, it is very distinct in the usage of the hops and leaves a good impression. I wouldn\'t call it well balanced like some other IPAs, but that is extremely forgivable because of the unique and interesting taste.Jun 11, 2011', 'Pours a bright, deep orange with a solid bone-white head that lasts well and leaves plenty of lacing. Big tropical nose, with mango and orange, notes of pineapple and cold menthol. Awesome. Taste is piney and bitter, with those fruity notes coming through well and a long finish. Crisp and well-carbonated, brilliantly drinkable. Just a fantastic IPA, really well put-together. One of my go-to beers, especially given that it comes in cans and is thus compatible with a day of sailing.Jun 06, 2011', ""Wow. This is the second time i've bought a 4-pack and it still delivers. As in most things in life, it's all about balance. When a beer such as this one achieves such a beautiful amalgamation of bitterness, body and flavor in perfect harmony, yet only boasts 6.5%, it's hard to forget. In the nose, really bright and fresh, resiny pine, pithy grapefruit and a touch sweet and toasty malts. In the mouth, all of the flavors in the nose follow through. First a staunch bitterness with a bit of pithy lemon and grapefruit, followed by a resinous mouthfeel. In the finish, the beer has great acidity that cleanses the palate and makes you want to drink more. The dude abides.Jun 03, 2011"", ""$3 pints at The Cottage! Hell yeah!

On the lighter side of medium-bodied, with a pretty clean, dry finish. Some piney hops linger for a little.Overall this was an excellent IPA.

This nose rivals any IPA and most DIPA.T: All that tropical fruit is present right on the tip of the tongue with a very clean and balanced pine right behind it.

Despite the light body, this is extremely resinous, almost to the point of drinking pine sap. It's very crisp and seemingly refreshing, despite all the bitter resins.O: While I probably prefer a little more body and sweetness, this is one of the most refreshing, yet extremely resinous IPAs I've had, with plenty of tropical fruit to boot.

The aroma is quite hop-filled. I believe that there is a lot of amarillo hops on the nose, but I've been wrong before when naming hops. The taste is quite herbal and grassy with a touch of citrus finish. There seems to be what I believe is cascade hops for bittering. I find that I like the usage of cascade hops in most IPAs.

I also get a slight piney/resiny note.As far as taste goes I get less citrus than in the smell and more pine notes followed by a nice bready caramel malt. Of course, there is some citrus and tropical fruit present, but they play more of a supportive role. The supportive role is played by citrus in the bitterness, and tropical fruit backing up the caramel malt sweetness. There is also definitely an orange sweetness in this beer.

The other tastes are provided mostly by the hops and taste nothing like the aforementioned beer. It follows the nose with its sweetness, reminding me of some tropical fruits but the nice pine bitterness does not let the fruitiness take over.Mouthfeel: Very nice to drink.

S- Fairly malty with a sturdy doughy, crackery base. Hops are piney and very dense smelling. It smells like its going to be oily and resinously bitter. T- There is a good balance kicked off by the doughy malt base. Pine comes in ushering some orange rind along with it. M- Insanely dry. I mean very, very dry. This is the driest finishing IPA, hands down. It makes for an easy drinking beer. It keeps the beer tasting clean and quenching. This doesnt have me convinced. Perhaps this can was from October, or perhaps this IPA isnt my style. Its good, not great. Certainly just above average.____Second consideration of a can given to me by AleWatcher.S- Lots of pine with an undercurrent of tropical citrus. Crackery malt is strong. T- Juicy up front with plenty of orange candy and light malts. Then comes the pine. Lots and lots of pine give this beer a healthy bitterness that can get quite formidable. The finish has a really nice floral and citrus explosion to it. The aftertaste is very bitter and long lasting, but thankfully it avoids most of the medicinal stuff, its very much loaded with pine resin though. The first can I had had to have been a bit too old.

So not expecting this out of Canada. Would like to get some more. Enjoyed tremendously.Cheers,The CPJMar 05, 2011', 'I just couldn\'t pass up this cute little can of beer, and now I\'m glad I didn\'t.It pours a hazy deep amber body beneath a short head of white foam. The head drops steadily, but it continually maintains a creamy collar along the rim; and it leaves nice splashes and small patches of spotty lace about the glass as it goes.The nose is really hoppy, loaded with Cascade! Pineapple, grapefruit, orange peel, resins! I also pick up some apple-like fruitiness, some bready/biscuity malt, a hint of dried pine or spruce, some floral character, and a bit of leafiness as well (I\'m not sure whether that\'s coming from the hops, or perhaps a combination of the malt and hops).In the mouth it\'s medium bodied and gently crisp. It seems to be \'can conditioned\', but I\'m not sure. The bubbles are certainly quite fine.The flavor delivers a really nicely balanced combination of caramelish malt and citrusy and softly piney hops. The pineapple character of the Cascades is brightened a bit by the apple-like yeasty fruitiness; and that seems well threaded throughout the maltiness. It\'s really well-combined and balanced. Quite often with a beer like this you\'ll get a hit of hops followed by maltiness, a smack of bitterness, and then a dry hoppy finish - but this is much more focused and put together. There are more hops at the front, for sure, but the malt is still always there; and it finishes the same way except that the hops become much more leafy. There\'s also no harsh bump of bitterness to it, instead it just rises to its high point just before the swallow, and then gently drops down and recedes in the finish. Nicely done!Overall, I quite enjoyed it. It reminds me of ""real ale"", and a hoppy one at that. If you enjoy hops it\'s really quite drinkable. Fresh and flavorful - well worth seeking out!Feb 28, 2011', 'Review adapted from notes taken 2/22/2010Slightly updated 4/5/13, now ""Red Betty""Appearance: Nice amber/orange color with a quality head, keeps some wisps of lacing, leaves some spots of lacingSmell: Citrus and herbal hops - grapefruit flesh, and some grassy/herbal notes - some nice caramel malts in the background - nicely balanced overallTaste: Above average, but certainly not mind-blowing - some grapefruit, some orange - herbal and grassy notes - the hop profile is great, very bitter with a nice bite - also some herbal, spicy, earthy dryness to the taste - malts are caramel and bready - nicely balancedMouthfeel: Medium-ish body, nicely crisp, surprisingly creamy and chewyOverall: Very drinkable - not exactly a palate-busterI think it is possible that my can was past the peak of its freshness. I don\'t exactly see this beer around too often, so I don\'t know. I may have to just go to Canada. Regardless, this is good stuff.Update: 4/5/13I still don\'t see why people rave about this beer. It\'s definitely better than average, and it has a very uniquely nice hop profile, but mind mind remains unblown. I did actually bump up the overall to a 3.75, which is probably what I would have put originally.Feb 27, 2011', ""Pours with a proper carbonation. Good head with reasonable retention. Smells very sweet with crystal malts. Smelling and looking at this beer it seems like a hoppy red ale. Bitterness is strong but not obnoxious. I prefer a bit more flavor and aroma hops in a IPA. I do like the idea of IPA's in a can because opaque materials prevent any kind of skunking. Seems like it would help preserve the hops qualities. Decent IPA.Feb 23, 2011"", 'From can to Bruges hybrid glass on 2/18/11A: A clean and clear ambery orange. Not much in the way of head, a mere one finger or so. Retention and lacing are meager.S: Fresh cut cedar. The heavy hop oil also strikes a bitter chord here too, but it\'s faint. Without question this is the highlight of the beer.T: Red Racer initally comes off slightly citrusy and sweet. By the time the brew reaches the mid-palate, the hoppy bitterness catches up like a dog on a leash. As it goes down, the malt bites my tonsils. It\'s really quite unique how all of these different and equally enjoyable aspects come together.M: Not what I was expecting. It\'s lighter then I would\'ve liked, and had they left this one unfiltered and pulled back on the prickly forced carbonation, this could be (and I stress ""could"") an outstanding American IPA. As it stands, this is the beer\'s weakest link.O: This is one I\'ve been hunting for, and I\'m glad to tick it off of my list. The nose on this one is simply marvelous, and if Central City ever gets into the air freshener business, I\'ll be first in line.As I mentioned above, the mouthfeel really doesn\'t do this one any favors. If they would cut back on the intense level of carbonation, it would really allow the subtle nuances of the hops to shine through.Regardless, this is a good beer. Here\'s to hoping that Central City\'s Red Racer find it\'s way to the DC market on a consistant basis.Feb 19, 2011', '2oz can into a standard pint.A hard pour results in two fingers of off white, rocky foam. The haed dissipates slowly leaving a quarter inch coaster on top adn some decent lacing. The beer is a hazy golden, orange color. Looks good!The aroma is citrus fruit forward with a hint of sweet sugar cookie. I\'m getting notes of orange, mango, and tangerine. I also detect some floral characteristics. Nice.The taste mirrors the nose. Juicy citrus takes center stage here, with distinct orange and tangerine flavors. Mild bitterness is present, but it is balanced nicely by the malt profile. Pine is largely absent in this one, but the refreshing citrus character of this brew makes up for it in spades. Super tasty!The beer is medium bodied with an appropriate level of carbonation. It doesn\'t quite achieve the creamy quality of say, Sculpin, but it is quite pleasant nonetheless.Drinkability is excellent. If I had to describe this beer in one word I would have to say it is ""delicious"". I am really enjoying this one. Wish it was available within driving distance, because I would drive to keep a couple of sixers of this in my fridge.Feb 16, 2011', '2oz can into pint glass at 45 degrees. Pours with a 2-3F foamy off-white head over a cloudy golden-to-amber colored body. Some carbonation present. Little bit of lacing.Aromas are really hard to discern - but mostly a sweet citrus, like orange juice. Great on the palate. Flavors are full of citric hops... lots of naval oranges, and a little bit of pink grapefruit pull. Fairly creamy, overall for an IPA. Drinkability is good, but not great for the style. Was expecting more in both the aroma and flavor, given the A rating - smoothness makes up for it, though.Feb 16, 2011', 'A- Looks pretty friggin sweet, very clear pale amber with a nice head and some retentionS -Grapefruit, and citrus from the moment I opened the can.

D- A pretty solid IPA, one of the better offerings on the market.Feb 13, 2011', ""Pours... red. Ha-cha.Smells bready, doughy, yeasty, and then floral hoppy. Big grapefruit and orange hops bounce wonderfully against the chewy malt. Tastes fantastic, an absolutely perfect exemplar of the style! The malt is big, bready, and assertive--almost like Rogue's double IPA, the yeast complexities are actually a big, intentional part of the beer's pallet. There's neat stuff going on here that's not hop-related!! It's been a while since I've come across an IPA like this, where the malt profile is as aggressive and adventurous as the hops. This requires that the beer be hopped expertly--not excessively--and that is apparently out of bounds for most brewers these days.Feb 11, 2011"", 'Poured from a can into a Sam Adams glass, canned in September 10, 2010Pours a beautiful pale amber color with a half inch head.

Very creamy, but this gradually fades to a more modest size, leaving generous lacing down the glass. The color is golden copper, and definitely unfiltered.Smell: Caramel and pale malt support the large hop aroma. Grapefruit citrus, spicy, herbal, and grassy hops are all apparent in the nose. It makes for a unique smell.Taste: There is a decent malt backbone to start. Pale malt gives a little flavor, and caramel malt a little more. Grapefruit hops are the first to hit, with some spices coming in next. The end turns herbally and finishes with a long grassy bitterness. Pleasantly bitter, but with enough malt to refresh my palate with each new sip. Mouthfeel: This has fuller than medium carbonation, with a crisp feel to it. Grainy. The body is fuller than medium. Leaves a resiny bitterness behind the lips.Drinkability: This is a solid IPA and well balanced to boot. The only issue is the grassy bitterness; that is not my favorite hop flavor.Feb 06, 2011', ""Have heard a lot of buzz about this one. Psyched to try it after picking it up at Hawthorne's in S Phila. I don't understand the bottling date code on the bottom of the can.I'd call this one gold, as in the metal not as in black-and-gold. Beautiful fluffy head doesn't last as long as I'd like, but it's an inch and a half tall before settling to great-looking lace.I get more hops in the taste than in the nose. I'm not savvy enough to pick out specific hop profiles, but I feel like this one is a little different from what I normally come across. I definitely dig it - more piney than citrus.

T: Following the nose, big piney taste hitting up front then a grapefruit bitterness within the finish. Bready malt character is there but is really hidden behind the floral hop arrangement. M: Semi-balanced beer, decent amount of carbonation, medium mouth feel.D: Fairly drinkable beer, little bit to piney for me, could use a tiny bit of more malt to back up the pretty full on hop arrangement.

Big grapefruit pith flavor with a correspondingly aggressive bitterness. Very resiny and earthy; doesn't quite have the dank, weed-like quality that the nose did, but that's just fine.

It makes my mouth water.T: The hop flavor has lost a little bit of edge from a fresh can, but there is still the citrus flavors coming through with a touch of the pine from the nose. The caramel comes through a bit more in this one because the hops have backed off, so there is an evident caramel and bread characteristic.M: A little sticky, no doubt from the age on it. Medium body with mild carbonation. Medium finish in the back.D: One of my all time favorites, its fitting to be my first review. Fresh is definitely miles better, but even aged (1.25 months) it is still pretty good. I could have a few in an evening for sure.

Particularly there's a little bit of orange. Another interesting aspect of the smell that's equally as strong as the citrus is a dry wheat with some acidity added.T: The start of this beer has the citrusy flavors of pineapple and tangerine. There's a good level of bitterness in the middle of this, which is a nice contrast to most IPAs that have the bitterness localized to the finish. The finish of this beer isn't really bitter at all, rather it is fairly metallic and earthy. Very Nice!M: Excellent mouthfeel. This beer finishes crisp and clean. It has a nice level or carbonation and sits well on the palate, particularly at the finish.D: Wow, so glad this is readily available here. I will be seeking it out again, and often.

The hops are the star of the show, with great bittering, flavour, and aroma characteristics coming through. Citrus zest and coniferous sap abound.

Smooth.D: Most good IPA\'s have me waking up in the morning feeling as though someone tried to asphyxiate me with a rag soaked in turpentine, especially if I have more than one. I smoked down five of these bad boys during a spirited game of euchre. Woke up at 7am, with no trace of Red Racer left behind. Bravo.Note. I just had a Two Hearted after finishing a Red Racer, and I can honestly say that Red Racer is AT LEAST as good. At this level, we\'re comparing a Mercedes to a BMW.

The aroma is just what I'd hoped for, very citrus-forward with grapefruit and orange, also some pine sap, all the great things hops can do. A bit of caramel malt to balance it, which is sort of a shame per my preferences but works sometimes.The beer tastes really good, the hops are expressed more with flavor than bitterness, although the bitterness IS there. Grapefruit, pine needle, etc. Not enough caramel malt to cause problems, but then again this is a 6.5% ABV construction. I suspect if Central City made a DIPA it would be the barleywine type but luckily this IPA is just fine.Good carbonation and body, altogether a worthwhile treat. The only real complaint is cost, I can't say it's really better than Two Hearted or several from Lagunitas, all of which can be had for $9-10 per sixer.

She's hot. A keeper. A: Popped the top and...a GUSHER! Ivory foam builds rapidly, an oozing eruption from the can; fortunately I caught nearly every drop. Cloudy, unfiltered complexion in a chestnut/auburn pour; a few small flecks of fallout rest at the bottom of the glass. Decent carbonation, but of any great strength or abundance. Lace as thick and white as the stockings worn by the girl on the can...sorry, I really can't stop looking at the label.S: Piney hops pop from the glass at first...the aroma wafts from 3' feet away where the glass sat on the table. Scent subsides and becomes more 'musty grain' and duller hops, still good strength just not as enticing.T: Wow! Now, that's an IPA: big caramel malt and pine tree resin and peppery spice to match. Green salad herbs, cut grass, plenty of pithy rind bitterness that tingles like an Arizona grapefruit. For all the brutishness of the hops, malts work deftly to balance - a little candy sweetness in the finish amidst the greenness.M: A mouthwatering coating of hop oils gives this a 'juicy' feel; medium body and crisp carbonation.

Very clear.Smell - Possibly biscuity, the hops really overwhelm the malt though. Hops have a leafy/grassy smell. No estery aromas.Taste - Much stronger than the aroma, bitterness is high, the four varieties of hops used create a complex taste that goes bitter, medium intensity, then a slight sweet or mild taste at the end that holds on. It does not hold on for a week like their Winter Ale. (Maybe having it 7 days/week last year was not normal consumption)Mouthfeel - Excellent mouthfeel, swirl it around and enjoy. Just right for the style, body is there but does not take over. Drinkability - This is my favorite IPA, and in terms of taste I would rate it A+ overall as this is what makes it really stand out. I have no idea how this review will score it, but I signed up with BA in order to rate this delicious beer from my hometown. I have to admit I've had several gallons of this in growlers, so if you are in the Vancouver area you would be better to stop in to fill up a growler or two as I noticed their best beers are not in cans. This is the IPA I use as a standard when I experiment with creating my own IPA's at home. Although this is my home town beer I would still recommend actually coming out to the brewpub to try most of what they have to offer.

Let's see how it stacks up...Nice even pour out of the can, crystal clear and almost fizzy with bubbles, bright and brassy. The aroma is deep into hop territory - definite grapefruit rind (yes!) and other citrus, almost a hint of cilantro. A good sign. And yes, it tastes delicious. Citrus hop profile, nice and bitter but not as biting or brash as I had expected. Lots of grapefruit, resiny, oily, real tasty. Malt is hiding somewhere. As nice as the hoppy feel good flavor is, I'm almost more impressed with the texture of this beer. It's just so dang light on the palate, airy and joyously quaffable. Not that it lacks body, and some IPAs are great with a chewy mouthfeel, but this is almost like an uber-hopped pale ale or something. Crisp like a lager, and like I said it's crystal clear.

If you've ever picked hops from the vine, you'll recognize the smell right away. The scent is extremely reminiscent of raw, unadulterated hops, which is pretty cool.

My only criticism is that it's not terribly complex... but don't let that stop you!For the mouthfeel is silky smooth and despite the beers lack of complexity in nose and palate - what it does do - it does exceptionally well. The beer goes down in gulps. Another can (and I only have 23 left) is in the works.Sep 16, 2010"", 'Nice but somewhat typical orange/amber mostly clear colored pour with a bit of white head.Aroma is mild but pleasant - piney hops dominate here.Flavor is much more bold with very strong tasty bitterness coming through big time with a nice hint of citrus around the edges.

Nice citrus hops, but also a big seaving of malts. Taste is malts, pineapple and mango with bitter orange rind. Finish is very crisp and clean, mouthfeel is a bit malty and heavy though. Very drinkable, although a bit too much malt and not enough hops.Sep 02, 2010', ""I picked this up on a recent trip to Calgary. Poured with a murky orange and apricot hue, opaque with one finger dense beige head and slippery, sheet lacing. Carbonation a bit muted but this remained one nice looking beer!Smell was awesome with pungent grapefruit and mango aromas, piercingly hoppy on the nose. Taste also of huge hops, enough to cause a pucker on the lips with grapefruit and orange citrus notes, brutally sharp on opening and settled a bit with air. Hoppy mouthfeel was no surprize considering the smell and taste but pine resins coating the roof of the mouth caused me to pause while writing this review. Dry and bitter with a bit of malty caramel sweetness trying to make an impression here and there. If you like your IPA's hoppy and multi-dimensional, this is the beer for you. A real delight to taste and savour yet presented with a bit more complexity than I expected, this deserves the high marks it gets. I only wish I could buy it in Ontario!Aug 31, 2010"", ""Great cloudy appearance. Nearly apple jelly-like in colour... kind of a mix of pumpkin, honey, and amber.

It's very hoppy / floral / fruity... very reminiscent of Hop Stoopid. This could be the best beer I've ever had from a can. It tastes very much like it smells... some juniper / pine, grapefruit, and a bit of lemon. There is a slight pepper (or spice/grain) taste in its bitter finish. Great mouthfeel. There's an airiness on the exhale... the back of your throat opens up. Carbonation is just right, and not sharp when held in the mouth.

Very Drinkable, a pretty awesome IPA from a can.Aug 28, 2010', 'Red Racer IPA looks good when held up to a bright summer afternoon sun; what appears gunky and smeared becomes a glowing, confident orange tone. The depth of its colour won\'t allow full fledged transparency but it becomes clear that its complexion is actually, well, clear. As for its head, even Michelangelo couldn\'t paint it any better. The hoppiness in this bouquet is as big as an SUV. It is piercingly citric and has enough bitter resins to singe your nose hairs off. It has all the pungency of onions and reeks a little like them too. Fortunately, fruit factors in more heavily than vegetables and mango, orange and grapefruit would give this a most tropical air... if only they didn\'t smell so bitter!If I could frame this taste and put it on my wall I would. It\'s like the most delicious creme brulee I can image - cream, sugar and vanilla custard - topped with candied grapefruit, orange zest and chunks of fresh mango. It is at once rich but light enough to be considered sessionable. And it has an almost spicy bite on the finish that is appreciably refreshing. Red Racer IPA has the level of violent and gluttonous, tongue-splitting, palate wrenching bitterness that you\'d expect someone like Quentin Tarantino would write for an IPA. Yet, curiously, it\'s irresistibly drinkable. On the aftertaste, the bitter, resiny, pithy flavours give way to more succulent, sweet tastes of caramel, cream and sugar. ""Smooth"" as they say. This had a lot of hype precede it and often that means that it\'s bound to disappoint. With this one, however, I don\'t know that any expectations could exceed the quality and character of what is, for all intents and purposes, one of the finest, highly regarded IPAs I\'ve tried. Don\'t try one - buy at least six. Trust me, you\'ll race through \'em fast enough.Aug 27, 2010', ""Served in a Devil's Backbone willibecher.And the Leaving Falls Church uber-bender rolls mercilessly on. This participant pours a clear tawny topped by a finger of off-white foam. The nose is heavy with lime-strong citrus hops, with some pine cross-hatched in there as well, all backed by oaky toffee. The taste continues along this path, with hops distilled from 50/50 or Squirt. The toffee is kinda dark, with a hint of char to it, but mostly maintaining its general sweetness. The body is pretty light, with a moderate carbonation and a finish that tries to dry. Overall, a nice IPA, nothing really all that special, but economical and tasty regardless.Aug 26, 2010"", ""Poured from a 12oz can into a US tumbler pint glass.A: The beer is a light golden brown color, with a large off-white head that fades slowly and leaves a spotty on the glass.S: The aroma contains floral hops, fruity citrus and caramelized malts.T: The taste starts with a strong bite of piney hops bitterness that is followed by a nice citrus and caramel sweetness.

Smell and taste are resinous pine needles, perfume, toasty malt, citrus fruit (tangerine, grapefruit), nectarine, and boldly bitter hops. A weak caramel backbone barely manages to poke through the hoppiness. Mouthfeel is oily, medium-bodied, delicate carbonation, juicy middle, drying hop bitterness lingers in the finish.

Great job, Central City.Aug 23, 2010', ""I had heard a bit of the buzz, and being a hophead and also a former Canadian expat, had to try this beer. Canada doesn't make a real IPA right- always a british bust? well now I am wrong?

Appearance: A nice copper color with some amber darkness coming through, nice bubbles coming to the top, and a slightly off-white head bubbling up around the edges of the glass. Slight raindrops left streaking the areas just above the body. Smell: Big resiny and citrus hops coming through, along with a bit of caramel and orange marmalade and candied citrus topping the bitter grapefruit bitterness and earthiness. Taste: The reason it's getting this high of a rating is because of the ridiculously long finish, that goes from insanely bitter to caramel to wildflower honey to candied oranges to lemon and back and forth for a while, and the resiny hops linger on the tongue. For a brew like this, that isn't even a DIPA, to have this much power, they're doing something right. One of the longest finishes I've ever had with an IPA. Initially, though, there's a good balance of resin, a little sweat sock, and a ton of earthiness, with some caramel and lingering apples. But again, wow, the power of the resin and rind and morphing in the finish is what gets this going above many others. Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied with a good creaminess, and a ton of bubbles that maintain that creaminess, rather than feeling spritzy and over-the-top. You can probably see what I mean by how many bubbles trail the brew as you tip the glass, and how many recharge atop the body once the glass is again on a flat surface. Beyond my expectations. Drinkability: I have a feeling this will become a staple for many folks if, or maybe once, it's more widely available. I wasn't going insane about it, but for complex brew like this that's actually sessionable, and clearly shows the quality put into it, you can't argue for the price. The only thing is: now I have to conserve the last five cans, which isn't going to be easy.Aug 18, 2010"", ""I picked up a 6-pack of this while on vacation in Vancouver; our honeymoon, actually! It was the one beer I was really looking forward to trying from Canada and was really excited to find it. Not so excited to pay $16 for the privledge but oh well. Such is being a BA.Served cool into a globe, Red Racer is a hazy copper orange color with thick white head. Nice retention to the head which settles slowly leaving stick lace behind.The aroma is spectacular. It's clearly very heavily hopped with tons of resiny citrus hops. I would love to know what they used in dry-hopping because it has a to-die-for aroma.Flavor is excellent as well with just tons of hoppy goodness. It doesn't have extreme bitterness as some IPAs. It's more like a Racer 5 that just comes across as clean crisp citrus. A solid malt body is present to stand up to all those hops. Very fresh tasting and something I think of as candied or sugared orange rind. It's nicely balanced from beginning to end but definately has the hops that an IPA lover craves.Mouthfeel is medium bodied with appropriate carbonation. It actually has a really soft feel that might be partly due to the can. Smooth carbonation almost makes it seem like it was served on tap. Speaking of which, I had it at the Alibi Room on tap and it was just as exceptional as it is from the can.Overall a fantastic IPA - probably one of the best I've ever had... and it's from Canada! Please bring this one stateside. It's not like we need another IPA but this one is top-notch.Aug 18, 2010"", ""Chilled can into a glass. Thanks Ted. A: Pours a clear amber body. It's well carbed, with good retention and some spots of lace. S: Pine, grass, caramel. It's maltier than I was expecting (given how some West Coast hopheads raved about it), but I'm not pretending that's terrible. It is just unexpected. T: It's malty, with a substantial caramel backbone, but it's obviously very fresh, with a bright green hop flavor. Pine needles, fresh-cut grass. A small grapefruit (pith and rind) flavor. It has noticeable lingering bitterness; I'm guessing this is why the malt is played up a bit. M: I prefer something with a cleaner finish, but it's still good. It's a little thick for an IPA. D: It's good stuff! I don't think I'd go out of my way to track it down since I can buy better stuff locally, but it's quite enjoyable.EDIT: On reading other reviews, I see that there was supposed to be a huge citrus burst in this beer. I barely got any citrus at all. Makes me wonder if I had an old can after all.Aug 18, 2010"", ""Pours an amber/orange color with a perfect sized head that fades slowly enough, also leaves quite the cap on top and some sticky lacing along the glass.The smell has that perfect balance between citrus and piney hops and compliment each other, in the back there is some caramel malt.Taste has a nice crisp body to it yet the carbonation is also rather soft and creamy, the hops are the show but the bitterness isn't overwhelming either, I like the citrus the most from this beer but there's also a piney presence so it isn't one-sided when it comes to the hops, there is a significant caramel malt backing but in the end it makes this beer more balanced and far more drinkable.It's weird that a canned Canadian beer can turn out to be such a great IPA, I'm just glad Maine happens to be one of the states that receives it right now.Aug 18, 2010"", ""Picked up a growler from Central City.

Hoppy! This is hard on the tongue. Immediately a big piney hop flavor with big bitterness to the finish. Not a juicy as the nose leads me to believe but still very good.

The intensity of the nose is average, nothing memorable on either end of the spectrum.T: Piney flavors, a decent hop profile, lend a pleasing bitterness to the ale. That hoppiness sits atop ample caramel and pale malts. Aged is evident, the hops have lost a step or two.

Huge piney resins in the nose. I also get grapefruit zest, tangerine, and some butterscotch. Kind of a mish-mash, but pretty nice smelling.This IPA reminds of a lot of east coast style IPAs that I've had. It actually tastes a lot heavier than a 6.5% IPA, seems almost more like a double IPA. There's a big butterscotch component up front. I don't really like butterscotchy IPAs in general. The hop profile comes in quick though and rescues the flavor. Juniper, spruce, pine, and slight grapefruit are the main components. Not getting much citrus here at all. I'm guessing they used a bunch of Simcoe. Mouthfeel seems a bit heavy for a regular IPA. It also seems a bit wet and chewy. I'm thinking the Final Gravity is not very low. Nice oilyness here makes it feel silky in my mouth.Overall this felt like a solid IPA, and I understand the high scores.

Small amounts of lacing are clinging to the sides of the glass. After a few short sips the head has now diminished to small islands of larger bubbles surrounded by the smaller beaches of tiny head. This IPA has a sweet hop aroma and rich caramel profile. Inviting robust Red Racer has my interests piqued. The first gulp bring a rush of bitterness and sweet caramel balance. The hops come with an earthy and piney taste. The finish is long lasting and complex. Citric and floral, sweet and thick. I could drink quite a few of these.

The aroma is delectable, dominated by citrusy hops, with grapefruit coming strong through both the nose and the palate. The beer is perfectly balanced between a slight caramel sweetness which is overwhelmed by the immensity of the grapefruit hops. The beer lingers nicely with a biting bitterness that recedes quickly.

It's actually much more balanced than I expected, with a definite caramel note and some malt sweetness. Don't get me wrong though-- the hops are the main attraction, and the flavor is quite good. Not so much juicy as piney and resinous. The bitterness and light citrus flavors create a flavor profile that is highly suggestive of grapefruit. Bitter, rindy, and tea-like aftertaste. I appreciate the medium-low carbonation and resiny mouthfeel.All in all, an excellent beer, with a sweet can design to boot-- I love the 50s cyclist girl, and also the green and black hop vine outlines in the background.

Taste begins with a little hop bitterness, but moves to a buttery, citrus (peach-like?), grassy, well-balanced set of flavors. Finish is mildly bitter.

Aroma is well balanced between sweeter smells & dryer scents and manages to be quite appealing.Taste is malty with an almost biscuit-like quality. An amber sweetness is in the forefront and it ends up being a bit sweeter than expected. Unfortunately, the hop strength fades as it warms, which throws off the delicate balance.This brew is smooth on the tongue and low on the hop scratch meter. It's more of a display of balance than power, most of the time, before it gives way to grapefruit sweetness.I could see this being the go-to beer for IPA fans who prefer something a hint maltier, and, as a nice alternative to the traditional American IPA, it succeeds.Jun 11, 2010"", 'I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my SA perfect pint glass.

Maybe there's a bit of brown sugar or molasses, but it's hidden by all of the aromatic hops. The flavor starts out with some grassy hops and a touch of sweetness I could detect in the aroma. It builds up to a big bitter taste that lingers on after I swallow. It's piney and citrusy. It's a full bodied IPA and each swallow leaves a bit of a sticky coat, but not as much as some imperial IPAs (what I'm trying to say is this beer has the consistency of beer that usually has a sweeter mouthcoat). The carbonation is apparent on my tongue. This is an extremely drinkable IPA. I have gone through a number of cans in an afternoon, but I've also sat back and slowly sipped a single 12 ounce serving. This is an IPA any fan of the style should seek out.Jun 07, 2010"", ""Red Racer IPA is slowly becoming noticed among beer geeks in both Canada and the US, and for good reason.

There's a healthy amount of fresh pine in the aroma which excites the beer drinker for what's next. Red Racer IPA is filled with hops. clean, crisp hops! It's only a little bitter, which is nice. Floral notes exists too. The malt is crackery/biscuity. It's also a little sweet, which the best I can describe is like fruit infused hops with a sprinkle of sugar. It's very smooth in the mouth, and is a pleasure to drink.Red Racer IPA lives up to the hype. A delicious beer that any any hophead would be a fool to turn down.

Definitely the tastiest single IPA I've ever had from a can, and one of the better ones I can remember, period.M - Medium bodied, with moderate carbonation and just a hit of resinous slickness.D - Downed the first can in about 2 minutes flat. This is a seriously drinkable beer. I'd bring a case of this to a BBQ in a heartbeat.Great beer. Definitely a welcome addition to the growing number of fine beers in a can. I love a good canned beer in the summer, and you really can't beat this one for less than $2 a can in a 6-pack.May 23, 2010"", ""Poured from can into a standard pint glass.Appearance: Pours a dark golden color with a finger of foam on top that settles after a few minutes. Smell: Hops, biscuity malt and a nice aroma of grapefruit, pineapple and mango. Taste: Bitter hops at first, followed by the grapefruit, pineapple and mango that I smelled and then the malty backbone. Very tasty beer. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with a dry, bitter finish. Drinkability: A very enjoyable IPA that is reasonably priced and very tasty. It's not all hops and it's not all malt, very good balance. I can see this becoming a regular purchase if not just me buying another six pack.May 23, 2010"", ""Lets see how my 1st Canadian IPA goes down. IPA going international. I love the concept.The head on this is insanely excellent. Rises up like a Phoenix from the ashes. Smells excellent. Pine and citrus fills the nostrils.Color is on the lighter side for an IPA, you can see through the glass, semi-clear, golden amber/brown, comparable to apple juice.Tastes rich, can really taste the malty flavor, the hop flavor is there, not over-powering though. Not the most bitter IPA I've had, slight bitterness at the end, but relatively subtle by my standards. Definitely tasting the citrus and pine more than anything right now. Not that dry either. Good flavor, not exactly what I was expecting, but definitely a well crafted IPA, goes down smooth and tastes really good. I was expecting a bit more hops/bitter/dryess but I think the way they did it is great, and I wouldn't change anything. A solid beer, I'd get it again and be happy with it.May 22, 2010"", ""Can into my pint glass.Best head ever. Two fingers, perfect fluffiness. Amazing! Copper orange color with white glorious head.Smells nice, peaches, pineapple, grapefruit, pine and the like.Taste is nice. I like this IPA's malt bill, but the hops are too bitter (like they were added too early in the boil). In my day, I would love it when a beer like this torches my taste buds with hops, but this is just a bit much. It's not Ruination but for some reason the bitterness in this one just lingers and I don't love that.Mouthfeel is nice and creamy.Strong, very flavorful, and bitter.May 21, 2010"", ""A - Slightly more than a fingers worth of tightly packed egg shell colored head... Impressive retention... A vibrant glowing orange color... Loaded with swirling vivacious carbonation...S - Surprisingly the hops don't dominate the nose... Actually quite a nice balance...

Loads of bready malts... Cracker... A touch of caramel... Everything works to gather well and adds layers of complexity... M - A slight kiss of foam hits the lips first... Medium bodied... Sturdy... Terrific carbonation... A little bit of chewiness... Lingering bitterness on the back of the tongue... D - A quite enjoyable American IPA in all aspects... Loaded with flavor and character... Also a quite sessionable 6.5% ABV... Much like the artwork, this a playful and seductive brew which I highly recommend and can't wait to pop open my next one...May 21, 2010"", 'copper in color with thick white head that fades quickly. The initial smell is strong of citrus hops but fades quickly as well. The taste is like biting into a centennial and cascade battered orange rind.

Overall decent beer.May 21, 2010', ""A- Pours an orangey-topaz with a large off-white head that settles down quickly. S- When I first popped the can, I got a nice little whiff of hoppiness, but it burns off fairly quickly. The aroma is mostly biscuity/bready malt and some grapefruit. There is just a hint of mango and orange as well.T- Lots of biscuity and bready malt just as in the nose. A solid grapefruit and orange presence accompanied with the bitterness on the back-end. Some cans are much better than others; some are way too biscuity and don't taste like IPA's at all.M- Medium bodied. Good carbonation. Not real flaws here.D- A nice drinking summer beer. Not quite as refreshing as I was led to believe, but still quite nice.Overall, a nice IPA when you get a good can, but consistency is a little bit of a problem. I would buy this again though.May 20, 2010"", 'very nice. brunt orange with an off-white head that holds and leaves rings of lace as the beer disappears. nose hits before i get the glass to my nose. huge wafts of citrus, pineapple, mango, pine, caramel and a hint of biscuit. taste is all of the above in proper three-way bitter/sweet/biscuit harmony. simple, yet defined and three dimensional with a nice, sweet roundness and a hoppy finish that uses the soft carbonation to accentuate it. i love how this beer hits in waves. sweet, then sweet tropical fruit... and biscuit, then sweet-dry in the end when the tingle of earth and pine become evident. medium body that screams to be chewed. simply delicious and goes down way too easily. this will be a regular for me all summer long.May 17, 2010', 'Pours a dark, slightly cloudy golden orange/tangerine color with golden yellowish orange hues when held to a light source and a two finger frothy yellowish beige head with very good retention, only slowly fading into a lasting ring.

Hints of pineapple, mango, orange and lemon peel along with pine needle and a subtle toasty caramel and biscuit malt character in the nose. Chewy medium body that is bursting with fresh sweet citrus and earthy bitter hops, along with a ton of tropical fruit flavor and a subtle malt backbone. The tropical fruit notes are really pronounced with hints of mango, pineapple, grapefruit and orange peel. There is also a bitter earthy dryness that keeps things in check with hints of earthy pine. Subtle toasty malt backbone with hints of graham cracker and biscuit provides decent balance without taking anything away from the delicious hoppy flavor. Although this beer is more complex than it seems, the hops are the star here and they linger throughout into a sweet yet dry finish. The ABV of this beer is very well hidden making it dangerously drinkable. I had to stop myself from chugging it down to fast. Highly recommended!May 14, 2010', ""oz CAN into a regular kitchen glass, looking forward to this one.Red Racer IPA boasts a kinda bright orange with some shiny bronze shades within. A clean looking beer with no haze at all. Two fingaz worth of off white foam that is quite creamy looking and condensed. A bunch of lace on the glass.The hops take up most of the nose with a big grapefruit bite and some pale malts to back it up with a sweet scent, slight caramel. Pretty bold and smells like the makings of a great IPA. Some small pine bitterness and hops on top of hops.Tropical fruit on top of a nice malty layer. Grapefruit, pineapple, others, some bisquit giving malt. I'm really liking the balance on this, it's pretty much even. Some grassy earth towards the end going into a bitter pine like essense. This is a stand out IPA.The feel is lighter than medium in build and a good amount of bitterness remains in the mouth for some time, I'm lovin it. Carb is just right not very high or overly crisp, I could drink this all day. I'm going on a camping trip soon and I think I just found out what Im bringing to drink. If Canadians can brew a west coast style IPA that mimiks the quality over there, than why cant the east coast breweries do the same? I mean they all use the same equipment and ingredients right, maybe it's something in the air, I don't know.May 12, 2010"", 'Crystal clear with a light amber body and a thick white cap of rocky and fine bubbles. Sticky foam coated the top of the glass and lacing was left behind as the beer disappeared into my belly. Sharp citrus aroma, bright grapefruit and a bit of pine resin. Notes of tropical fruit appeared as it warmed a bit. Same in the flavour, along with some biscuit and caramel sweetness, some floral character, and solid bitterness that lingered long into the finish along with a bit of citrus/spicy hoppiness. Creamy carbonation, medium bodied with a bit of dryness, nice texture overall. This is a solid IPA and one that I really enjoyed.May 08, 2010', 'Big ups to Jlindros for sending this along as an extra in a trade!Comes in a rather cheeky green can adorned with hops and sporting a fetching redhead astride an old school bike that immediately makes me forget about Fat Tire. There\'s a red maple leaf on the can, an advertised 6.5% abv, and an illegible born on date on the bottom. Nice packaging overall.A. This foams out of the can (???!) when I crack it, necessitating a hasty pour into my trusty Sam Adams glass. This can was refrigerated upright for days prior, so I\'m not sure what this is about, but eventually I get it in the glass and it pushes up a crackling, big-bubbled 3 finger tall head that dies fast, leaving behind a clear, still, light copper ale. I resist the urge to make a joke about feisty redheads that lose interest fast, and move on.S. Mmm, hops. Wonderful nose here, big (but not too big) citrus hop aroma expertly balanced with interesting and adequate malt. Picking up grapefruit, pine resin, semi-sweet malt and some sweetness. Hard to pin down, but rest assured this is Good Stuff. This is what real IPAs should smell like.T. Surprisingly good! I can\'t recall any Canadian beers that were this hop-forward, but this is a winner all the way. As per the nose, a fine blend of sweet roasted malt and big, bold citrus hops works quite well together. Dangerously drinkable - I\'m down to 2 inches left in my glass and I\'m only half-way through this review! M / D. Not much to say here - medium body, slightly low carbonation -- odd, considering how foamy this was at first - and boasts a fantastic finish, all low sweetness and wonderful, succulent citrus hops that are neither too bitter or astringent but rather fade away softly, leaving you wanting more. Grand stuff.Red Racer was a real surprise from a brewery I knew nothing about. This can easily stand up to some of the the ""classics"" of the style, ie, SN Torpedo, Stone IPA, etc. British Columbia should be proud to have such a good IPA at their disposal, and I frankly would like a lot more of this. The best IPA in a can I\'ve had? Maybe so....May 02, 2010', 'Red Racer IPA from Central City in Surrey, BC, is one my all-time favourites. Appearance is a slightly-hazy orange-hinted colour typical of American-style IPAs. Lots of lace around the glass when poured.But it is the first drink and sniff that gives the game aware. Fistful of citrus, grapefruit taste and smell.The taste is big, robust mouthful of hops. Not a sipping beer. Very smooth tasting with a long, lingering aftertaste of hops.Red Racer IPA deservedly was quoted Beer of the Year in BC by local CAMRA for the last two years.May 02, 2010', ""Poured from a 12oz can into a tulip glass.A: Color is a burnt orange with hints of amber. Poured with a one inch off-white head. Splotch lacing.S: Oh, smells those hops. Nice piney, green hops up front with some citrus hops mixed in as well. There's a caramal, malty backbone present. But the smell is definitely all about the hops.T: Picking up a lot more tropical notes on the taste than in the smell. Pineapple and mango mixed in with the citrus hops. Piney, green flavors really take a back seat. Caramal malts and some bready flavors come in mid taste and stay through the finish. The finish is bitter, but not overly so. Slightly on the chewy side. I think the finish is the one area where I would mark this beer done.M: Medium body and medium to medium-low carbonation. Generally in style. A little chewy on the finish.D: For a Canadian IPA, this is solid. Generally anticipate Canadian IPAs to really hold back on teh hops and taste more like a pale, but this one really surprises. If this was readily available (and a little more affordable by US standards), it would be a regular.Apr 30, 2010"", 'Poured from a 12 oz. can into a pint glass.a - Pours a reddish amber color with two inches of white head that has great retention.

There is a sticky bubbly two finger head that fades to a tight cap, leaving sheets of sticky lacing on the walls of the glass.The smell is outstanding. Citrus, oranges, mangos, grapefruit and lemon zest. Along with all the citrus there is a decent amount of pine. There is just a hint of caramel and sugared candy in the background. The taste is not as defined, or pronounced as the smell, but still good. The citrus notes are first and foremost, mango, pineapple, oranges and lemon zest. The piney bitterness plays second fiddle, and all the hops are nicely balanced by caramel malts. The beer is well carbonated, well balanced and the alcohol is well hidden.

Strong and syrupy notes of grapefruit, pineapple, light mango and melon, pine resin and herbal hops with a zesty orange twist.

Piney resin and herbal hops play as more of a backbone while all the sweet stuff goes on and is paired towards the end with a crusty bread finish.Perfectly balanced, medium bodied, smooth, crisp, lightly creamy, and refreshing. I can't ask for anything more. Tooo easy to drink.Overall, the best IPA I have had to date, and proud to have it be coming from Canada. Thank god for Premier Wines and Spirits down here in Halifax for carrying such a great selection. I paired this with some Italian gorgonzola and it went great.

There is a notable amount of spice, especially pepper, tropical fruits, peach, and citrus at the end.

On closer inspection, it seems to be yeast fragments from the ring that was agitated from the can. Looks almost like something that came from a mouse... 8:(Candied apricots and caramel flavors, leafy herbal bitterness, and a spicy, floral nose. Lemon and grapefruit peel. Fairly sweet in the middle and it dries a little bit in the spicy finish. Still pretty fresh and kickin'. Body is light and it's dangerously drinkable.

Poured a translucent copper with a frothy, 2.5 inch cream-colored head. Head that eventually settles into a fairly consistent skim with delicate strands of lacing and excellent adherence. Nose reveals characteristics of both grapefruit and herbal hops. Taste consistent with nose - not a lot of complexity, but perfect balance; just the merest suggestion of bittering lingers between quaffs.

Light malt, a little pink peppercorn, and a light herbal note as well. Surpassed my expectations.More malt on the palate, a touch of caramel, pursued by a heady wave of grapefruit and orange zest - sweet, bitter, and refreshing. A little bread crust and melon into the finish which is tart and fairly dry.Medium-light bodied, creamy, and well carbonated.

Pretty lush little hop aroma on this, smelling very floral, spicy, and citric, with a tangy underpinning of sweet malts underneath it. Just a nice fresh pop to this. The taste is spicy and biting up front, with a splash of grapefruit adding an extra layer of bitter juiciness to the profile. Caramel and bread give this a good balancing tang but the finish is all about the hops, being seriously strong with spice and bitter fruit rinds. The mouthfeel is medium bodied in the mouth, with a generally smooth slickness to it that works itself into more of a pleasant creaminess towards the back of the swallow. The alcohol is very well hid here, helping keep the drinkibility of this up. Really good canned IPA offering here, that packed plenty of hop character into a well balanced and easy drinking package.

The smell is delicious.The taste offers exactly what the smell presents initially. The beer is deliciously hoppy with a perfect balance of citrus and pine hops. The best part about the beer is as it warms, a distinct pineapple flavor becomes present which increases its scrumptiousness. There is a nice malty exit that is not very overpowering.The mouthfeel is exceptional and ranks equally with many IPAs. It almost feels as if it could be a dIPA.The beer has a powerful hop-forward taste but the alcohol is almost perfectly masked which heightens its drinkability.

M: Prickly carbonation feels appropriate. Slightly creamy. Nice fresh-hop aftertaste that lingers on, but in a pleasant way. D: High. The only thing stopping me from grabbing another is the fact that I gave my other can to a friend. I could easily have several of these in one sitting.The strong reviews are accurate. This is a very well done west coast style IPA. Who doesn't love a great beer in a can? This would definitely be a go-to beer for me if it was available in the area.

Encouraging indeed!Taste is lively with lots of piney, grapefruity-citrus hops right up front and throughout intermixed with caramel and a good amount of bready malt flavours on the finish and linger which provide for a beautifully hoppy yet balanced IPA.Mouthfeel is bright and prickly with a surprising touch of cream and a bit of that classic IPA oilyness. The Finish is nice and clean with a touch of spice on the linger.As for drinkability, there's not much to complain about. I could see myself drinking a few of these in 1 sitting way too easily.

Great looking beer, and just the color I like from an IPA.S: Fresh hoppy aroma is mainly floral and piney, with just a hint of caramel malt backing it up. Pleasant and straightforward, but not particularly deep or complex.T: Terrific, zesty explosion of hops up front - hugely floral, with some pine and citrus as well - followed by some pretty dry, almost biscuity malt before the intensely bitter finish. It\'s breathtaking right up until a bit of astringency creeps in on the aftertaste, but this is a pretty minor quibble. Delicious IPA.M: The body is a bit on the light side of medium, with soft, moderate carbonation. Pretty good.D: The overly bitter aftertaste continues to bother me, but this beer is tasty enough to transcend such complaints. I could easily and gladly drink more of these.Notes: I\'ve been wanting to try this one for a while, and lo and behold Thorpe429 hooked me up with a can as an extra. Unlike the UPS driver who broke the growlers I sent him, this beer did not disappoint. It was fun to try a West Coast IPA that wasn\'t from CA. Good stuff.Cheers!Mar 18, 2010', 'I drank this from a 12oz can into my Orval glass.The beer pours a very clear light orange with an off white head that only rises about half a finger and is gone right away. The aroma is really nice. Perfect combination and sweet and better. Starts off with a really nice sweet citrus fading into a perfect amount of hops, enough to know they are there but not all dominating. The taste is equally as nice. It starts off a little sweet then fades into a great hoppy finish. An almost pefect ipa balance because in neither respect does the other overpower the other.The feel is nice, with a very long lasting dry finish. Overall, this was a great little ipa. Could almost be a really nice ipa sessionalMar 15, 2010', ""OK, so I've heard some grumbling about this beer and was excited to give it a try. I actually love that it comes in a can. We are off to a good start here. Pours with a beautiful creamy off white head with excellent retention and structure. Bright orange amber in color with excellent clarity. Clumps of lacing everywhere. On the last pour from the can some dark floaters went into my glass. They slowly made their way to the bottom of the glass. More than just sediment, which usually mixes into the beer and makes it hazy. These were larger and sank.Aroma is fantastic and fresh. Huge perfume like hop presence. I think I'm getting more pine resin type aromas along with some grapefruit peel. A whiff of alcohol. Almost reminds me more of a DPA vs. a standard. Wow, excellent IPA. Living up to the comments I heard. Still feels a little more assertive for a 6.5% ABV, but quite nice. Juicy hop explosion. Lots of fruity esters and a bit of cracker malt breadiness. The hop punch is big/fresh and wonderful.Body is light, but hops make the mouth feel large! Wonderful.This is a great IPA and just made my regular purchase list. For a hop head this is fantastic. Great IPA!Mar 14, 2010"", 'Got this as an extra from lunch on a recent trade. Poured from a can into my SA perfect pint glass. Nice copper color with medium white head that dissipates into a decent sticky lace. Nice grapefruit aroma. Taste is slightly metallic im sure due to the can but is still quite good.

Lots of aromatic hops smelling of pineapple and orange with a little bit of bitter grapefruit. Very rich and fruity, I like this one.Taste- Very hop forward but not quite as fruity as I was expecting. Starts out with bitter grapefruit and pineapple citrus flavors but is rounded out with a healthly amount of resiny bite on the finish. Very solid flavor profile.Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Good here on both accounts. Slick and substantial with very good carbonation and goes down easy with the nice flavor profile.Overall, a very good IPA.

T - Lots of hops in here with primarily citrus and piney attributes, but also herbal and perfumy notes as well.

I had heard this described as ""baby Furious"" and that actually comes pretty close.T: Some sweet malt in the background, which balances things out a little bit, but this one is almost entirely hops. Definite earthy and herbal hops with bits of citrus. Hoppy flavors, although it\'s not terribly bitter.M: Medium body with a smooth creaminess. Slightly chewy.

A very nice layering of the citrusy/piney hop aroma sitting on the caramel malt backbone. Very nice!T: This is very nicely balanced. The hop flavor is a mixture of citrus and pine (I get pineapple also) and the malt keeps it all in check. One thing I am noticing right now that I've never noticed before in this beer is that I'm definitely tasting some of the alcohol in the back end of it. I know this is only 6.5% abv but I'm definitely feeling some of the heat. M: You don't get a lot of carbonation in this. I feel like it should have a little more. It definitely has a nice medium body for an IPA but it seems a little on the flat side. D: The citrusy aroma and taste of the hops are what make this beer very attractive. It is a very tasty beer. The alcohol in the taste and the slight lack of some carbonation detract slightly from this. Overall I really like this and would put this in my 'second tier' of IPA's!

Smell is great as well, huge citrus/tangerine + grapefruit scents, and maybe some apple etc. Taste is unexpected, doesn't match the smell at all. There is a strange unidentifiable taste right off the bat, I can't quite put a finger on it. Someone in another review said tea leaves, maybe that's it. The strange taste along with some grassy notes mask any other potential flavors, leaving a bready caramel aftertaste. From the smell I expected a fruity crisp IPA but that's not what I'm getting here. Not bad but I prefer usual IPA flavors over this. Mouthfeel is good, a little more creamy than average for the style with a smooth malty finish. Good, but definitely hindered I think from that strange taste.Mar 03, 2010"", ""A: Nice copper-amber body. Good clarity. Huge off-white head. Nice and creamy with solid retention. Lacing provides good coverage of the glass after each sip.S: Nice, if not mild, hop presence. Mostly grapefruit, orange and some light pine notes. Significant caramel sweetness.T: Subdued blend of light, but pleasant citric and pine notes. More malt than the nose would suggest. People have described this as a prototypical west coast IPA, but I just didn't get that impression. M: A bit lighter, in a thin-at-times kind of way. Nice bitterness throughout though.

The bT: Like I noted above, the raw resiny hoppiness is balanced perfectly by a solid malty backbone. There is some sweetness, but it's not cloying or overdone. Bitterness is present, but it's very fleeting and mostly on the finish. M: Medium bodied. Great viscosity on this brew. There is a little stickiness, but not much. The ample, but not overabundant carbonation helps make this nice and smooth.D: This is EXACTLY what I'm looking for in a sessionable IPA. The 6.5% ABV is never noticeable, the hoppiness and bitterness are there, but they don't abuse the palate. I've been calling this Furious' little brother, and that's some very high praise.

You won't be disappointed!Feb 26, 2010"", ""Red Racer IPA has a very clear, dark golden colored body with highlights of red and orange. Slow moving carbonation bubbles slowly ascend to the fluffy, off-white head. The head settles to a foamy ring on top of the beer, leaving some good lacing along the side of the glass.The aroma has a strong, bitter, grapefruit smell. Besides that there is a little bit of malt, but not much else. Lots of hops though, a quality aroma for an IPA.Red Racer IPA is packed with hops like a good IPA should be. Tons of bitterness with flavors of grapefruit and pine resin. After that some caramel flavored malt brings some balance, but doesn't do much to get in the way of the hops. This is a quality, hopped-up IPA; I like it. Rating-wise it probably falls between a 4 and a 4.5, but I'm going with a 4 here.The mouthfeel is medium bodied with just a hair over moderate carbonation.For a hop lover Red Racer IPA is a pretty good beer.

Then you crack it open and take that first sniff....The beer pours a fairly light orange amber color with pretty good head retention and lacing. On the nose, this is a pretty yummy smelling IPA. There is a bit more noticeable sweet malt in the background then I'd like to see, but otherwise there is considerable white pepper, celery salt, citrus and a touch of pine, showing off the hoppy bitterness in this beer. The blend of sweet malt with the hoppy bitterness gives this beer some interesting tropical fruit flavors. On the palate, this is an impressively bitter IPA, but there's still some noticeable sweet malt and alcohol on the finish that I'm not in love with. Still, there's no denying that this beer displays a considerable amount of hoppy bitterness that really dominates the flavor profile. The beer is made very much in the West Coast style, and is on the dry side for IPA's. Very, very nice. Mouthfeel is fairly light, though there's no denyig the flavor packed flavor profile. Also, the beer finishes with a nice clean, refreshing, crispness that I quite like. Drinkability is good, but there's something of an alcoholic bite in the finish that I'm not totally in love with. Hmmmm.... I can see the similarity between this and Blind Pig, as a friend (Dyan) suggested. However, I just can't say it's quite in the same class with the pig. While undeniably excellent, it just doesn't have quite the level of bitter intensity that I love so much in Blind Pig. That being said, there is no doubt that this is a very good beer... after Surly's furious, probably the best beer I can ever recall drinking out of a can . Impressive.Thanks Dyan!Feb 16, 2010"", 'If you have ever heard of the term ""West Coast IPA"" this beer is the definition of that. It\'s a light copper, a beautiful white head that leaves all kinds of sexy lacing. As soon as you crack the can you\'re assaulted, in a pleasant way, with citrus, creamsicle hop aromas with a smattering of pine and whispers of grapefruit and sweet malt. The pine intensifies in the taste and mingles with the citrus and hints of fruitiness to coat your mouth in that tantalizing way that hops like to work. A nice delicate malt backbone of caramel, biscuit, and a slight sweetness back up the hops. The dry finish, smooth body, perfect carbonation and 6.5% abv make this a dangerous beer. One is not enough.Feb 14, 2010', ""Thanks to indiapaleale for sending this my way via his Nice Cans BIF. 12oz can into a Dogfish Head off-centered pint.Red Rocket...errr...Racer 5....uhhh, I mean RED RACER (yeah, that's it!) pours a crisp peach body with a copper core. Evenly distributed carbonation throughout fuels a well-retained manila head that sticks a few splotchy swaths of lacing along the inside of the glass. Exceptional aroma makes my head spin with all the hoppiness: foresty pine (Simcoe?), grapefruit zest, sugared pineapple chunks, fresh grass--it's all in there, and it's all insanely enticing.Tea leaves hit the palate first, throwing me into more of an English IPA mindset. Definitely sweet tea with a hint of lemongrass and peach. Maybe some cotton candy, too. The hops come in bold and bitter mid-palate, and linger long into the finish with a burst of resinous pine and citrus. A spritzy carbonation level seals the deal, while the medium-light body is crisp, juicy, and dry at the end. Overall, Red Racer is an immensely enjoyable, drinkable brew.

Big aromas of pine and grapefruit backed up by sweet malt. Great smell but I'm left wanting more of it. Lots of hops. Bitter and drying, it's quite earthy. Pine seems to be dominate with some grapefruit in the background. This is very much a West Coast IPA, the hops clearly outbalance the malt profile, though not in an overwhelming way. Dry, piney aftertaste. The ABV isn't detectable. Good feel: creamy medium body with a light carbonation. If I lived somewhere where this was readily available, it would always be in my fridge. I can't wait to get my hands on some more of this stuff. Incredibly drinkable and very sessionable. This beer easily makes company with the best IPAs I've tried.

Off white foam coats the beer with an even 1"" blanket that laces very well. A classic IPA look.Assertive grapfruit, orange zest, pine resin, and fresh cut grass dominate the rim of the glass. The hops allow just a peak at caramel malts that offset the pungent display of hop oils.Flavors are very citrusy up front with the rinds of orange, grapefruit, and lemon grass. Light hints of ginger and pine give an extra bite above and beyond the normal IPA\'s. Bitterness is aggressive and bite pretty hard in the back of the throat. Even with the aggression, the beer remains smooth and crisp with the graham cracker malt buffer.Medium malty up front with emphasis on hop flavor- later fading into a crisp and fleeting bread crust note and growing hop bitterness.I like the ""back to basics"" attitude of this beer.

There's quite a bit of hop flavor too, very fruity with pineapple, orange, a little bit of raw mango. Malt character is present but more as a dry, cracker-like flavor rather than a caramel sweetness.

Remember, ""[c]larity is [way] overrated""! Nose was filled with piney hops, leaving no doubt that this was an American IPA, despite having been made in CANada. My mouth was absolutely watering in anticipation. Mouthfeel was medium with a fantastic hops bite on the tongue, scrubbing away the taste of all of those crappy adjunct lagers that I have been subjected to lately. This was sooo good! I love American IPAs and having it come in a CAN is a double-plus bonus. Finish was as hoppy as a cross between a kangaroo, a frog and a rabbit - extra hoppy. More, please!

Comes in a 12oz can with a picture of a voluptuous red head on a red bike with a green hop filled background. Long live the can. Poured into a tulip right out of the refrigerator.A- Vigorous pour fills the tulip to the top with a 3 finger rocky foam. The head is very uneven and dissipates from the bottom, not the top, leaving a pumice-like lacing. The color is a deep orange with some chill haze right out of the can. The lacing is legendary all the way to the bottom.S- Balanced between an aggressive citrus hop character and nutty-sweet malt character. These elements play a tug-of-war of the nose. In a way, it reminds of sweet-tarts.T- First impression was a lack of flavor hops (citrus/floral). A malt sweetness through the middle. The bitterness is there in the finish, but takes a while to grab hold. As the beer warms, more grapefruit shows and the sweetness mellows. At the right temperature, the thought of sweet tarts comes back.M- Moderate to heavy carbonation. Dry, but with enough body to support the bitterness. D- Highly drinkable, even at the upper level of the IPA family.Jan 05, 2010', ""This fine brew was an extra in a recent trade with mikesgroove. (Thanks man!) Enjoyed in a nonic pint glass.Appearance:The color is deep gold tinged with orange, and it is slightly hazy. The foam on top is snowy white and doesn't leave much lacing. Head retention is low.Smell:A great start! I opened this one on a counter at waist-height, and I immediately smelled a good gust of tropical and citrusy hops. Lots of grapefruit and orange peel and pine up front, along with notes of fresh papaya and pineapple. There's some bready and malty sweetness too, but it's far behind the hops.Taste:Starts with flavors of oranges and sweet bread, like an orange muffin. A big wave of citrus hop flavor and bitterness comes through next, filled with notes of grapefruit, dried papaya, and pine sap. The tropical fruitiness and pine give way to a tasty biscuit-y maltiness at the swallow, though the citrus and bitterness persist through the end and into the aftertaste. This is a terrific example of a West Coast-leaning American IPA: very hop-forward, but with enough malt to keep it from being one-dimensional.Mouthfeel:Medium-bodied with moderate carbonation. Starts crisp, goes smooth through the middle, and ends with a mild and drying astringency which begs for the next sip.Drinkability:I wish I had a lot more of this beer. Partly because I'd love to stack it up against some of the West Coast's best IPA's in a blind taste test, and partly because this is a fantastic IPA which I'd love to drink again. And again. Central City Brewing should be extremely proud of this one. I'm about to go add it to my Wants list.Jan 02, 2010"", 'Got this as an extra in a trade with jlindros. I was immediately entranced by the lovely lady on the can and decided to make this my first review of my haul.Good looking pour with a generous white head which subsides into a collar and leaves decent lacing on the glass.Citrus scented hops are the most prominent feature of the aromas and hops are the most prominent feature of the taste as one would expect. However the hops not completely over the top and a nice bit of sweet malt and some biscuit/crackerlike malt mixes in. This is a very pleasing synthesis of hops and malt without one totally obliterating the other. Moderately carbonated mouthfeel, and VERY easy to drink.Most of my experiences with Canadian beer outside of Quebec province have not been exactly scintillating, but this is a very respectable example of an American IPA(IPeh), and the more I drink the better it gets.Dec 30, 2009', ""Poured from a can into my Southern Tier pint glass.

Cool looking design on the label, has a vintage 1950\'s look. The beer pours a yellow/amber color with very good clarity, only the slightest haze. Has a large white foamy head with no two bubbles the same size, very good lacing to it. Hops dominate the smell on this IPA, I smelled it from the can before pouring it and citrus hops attacked my nose as it warms up I believe I can detect a piney aroma as well. The taste is maybe just under par of the smell, but still quite good. Kind of one of those flavors where I wish I could give it a ""4.25."" Much like the smell it is the citrus hops that stand out to me. However I feel this is a very reasonably malted IPA because the initial taste is sweet. Again as it warms up the taste of pine is detected, but it also leaves an earthy taste that brings the flavor scale down only slightly. Mouthfeel is good, feels lighter than I expected, good bitter finish from the hops. Probably the most drinkable IPA I\'ve had in quite some time. I\'m giving the drinkablility a perfect 5, but this was a change in pace of what I\'m normally drinking this time of year. IPA\'s are my summer stand by so I\'d like to get more in the summer and maybe tweek this a little now that I think about it.

Very nice thick lacing is left on the inside of the glass.S: WOW! Definitely the best smelling canned IPA (or canned beer for that matter) I have ever experienced and certainly one of the best smelling American IPAs period. As soon as the can was cracked, the citrusy hops exploded with lushes tones of orange marmalade, flowers, grapefruit, tropical fruit, lemon, pine, with slight malty backbone.T: The hop flavors continue onto the palate with citrusy layers of grapefruit, orange marmalade, orange zest, and pine. A slight caramel malt rounds out this delicious American IPA. There is just a slight bitterness to the finish which nicely cleanses the palate.M: Medium-bodied with nice creamy carbonation and very smooth.D: Exceptionally drinkable and the flavors are so rich and fresh with no hint whatsoever of the 6.5% abv.Overall this beer was a great surprise and a generous extra that came completely out of left field and completely wowed me.

Highly Recommended.Dec 01, 2009', 'Central City: Red Racer IPA (Tasted 11/30/09)12 oz. can, poured into a pint glass.Appearance: Slightly hazed gold with a monstrous off-white head of sea foam that leaves rings of lace on the sides of the pint glass as it fades, solid half-inch of residual head.Odor: Damn. White grapefruit with a healthy dose of waxy rind, orange and some spice from the hops. Low riding crystal malt aroma melds perfectly with the hops, lending a a rich candied pineapple background scent. A little subdued for style, but what it lacks in intensity, it more than makes up for with variety.Consistency: High end of light bodied, bordering on medium. Hop oils and low carbonation make for an ultra clean, smooth drinking experience. Flavor: The aroma is very telling. Mouth full of C-hops, grapefruit. pine orange. Once again, the light honeylike/candied malt gives a sweetish, tropical fruit dimension to the hop flavor. Bitterness is firm, obviously going above and beyond balancing the malt. Finish is clean, hops dominate, leaving a light coating of bitter oily goodness on the tongue.Man, it\'s expectional IPA\'s like this that make me smile. It\'s a hop bomb alright, it\'s unbalanced, but the beer isn\'t dry or sweet to the point of absurdity. Glad this is available in MA and in cans no less!

Tastes very citrussy, lemon and a bit of grapefruit particularly come to mind, with some pith herb, zest... Malt is there but only in the background, though it's fairly pleasant and pronounced with notes of toffee, coffee, and chocolate toward the finish. Medium bodied with moderate to ample carbonation. A really easy-drinker, this beer is disappearing faster than I'd like it to. A pleasant surprise! A top-notch IPA right up there with the best ones from south of the border (US).

Poured from the can into a pint glass.Appearance: Pour gives a somewhat rocky, but foamy, off-white 1.5 finger head. Great amber/gold color. Head recedes to a thin layer on top and ridiculous lacing.Smell: Overwhelming aroma of grape fruit. And I mean that in the best way possible. Strong pine notes. Very resinous. This rivals Pliny the Elder, no lie. I put the aroma of this beer up there with the best IPA's and even some of the best DIPA's.Taste: Holy cow! Grapefruit. Pine and orange peel too, but grapefruit is the dominant flavor of this beer. A decent malt backbone, but the hops never disappear. The bitterness about halfway through lasts through the finish and is second only to the grapefruit.Mouthfeel: Medium carbonation that is subtle at first, but splashes all over the mouth right before you swallow. Bitterness lingers for literally minutes after the swallow if you give it that much time before another sip. Lingering hop oils coat your tongue, leaving a lasting grapefruit flavor.Drinkability: Not very heavy, the malt backbone only exists as a very temporary balancing agent, and in no way weighs this beer down. If your a hop head, or can handle such oily and resinous hops, you could drink a few of these.Pretty sure this is my first Canadian beer. And it gives me a new found respect for Canada. Great beer!Nov 17, 2009"", ""Good starting head that leaves some ring lace. The liquid light amber and clear.Strong pine-grapefruit citrusy aroma--like a true IPA.This is a hop-lovers IPA, which says a lot given the nature of a typical IPA. I cannot detect any malt because the hop is the beginning, ending and aftertaste of the tasting. I'm speculating, but I think the bittering hop is one of the high-alpha kind. Still, it is tasting very fresh. Lighter body than expected.Nov 15, 2009"", 'I am just thankful that I can buy this beer in Massachussetts. I would probably never buy this beer from looking at it on a shelf mixed with bottled of IPAS and DIPAs, but Damn. This is the best tasting HOP bomb (I prefer it to Hopslam and Hop Stoopid). For some it maybe a sipper, but for me it is highly drinkable, and the flavor is bold and non-stop. I took a sip and went to read a story to my daughter and could still feel the citrus flavors followed by a ripe grapefruit finish in my mouth.

Clear as day with a rich orange tinted amber color that held together very well. Nice two inches of head on top quicky settled down to a thin film which thoroughly coating the entire inside of the glass to the point nothing could be seen inside. The I lean in for a whiff. Holy citrus knockout. This thing is a cannon of hops. Rich orange and tangerine notes lined with loads of pineapple and grapefruit. This is just insanely fresh. Even warming does nothing to depart from the super fresh hops that are just owning my face right now. Intense is not even the right word for it. Crisp and clean taste offers more of the same, just intense and crisp, hop flavor all over the place. Pineapple and grapefruit dominate, clean dry finish with super sticky resin like flavors, not an ounce of balance here and none needed.

Nicely citrusy and sweet, only a hint of pine. Wow.Central City nailed the style. Grapefruit flesh with a little rind and pine thrown in against a very subtle, very nuanced sweet malt backbone, but whereas the lack of a strong malt presence is normally a shortcoming for an IPA, it totally works here, as the hops are the star of the show and they're so deftly handled adding more malt would seem like cheating, if not ruin everything. Honestly, the bitterness is not overdone or underdone. It's spot on, really, and just as bitter as it needs to be. No more. No less. I can find no fault with it. This is the best hopcentric beer brewed in Canada that I have ever tried--hell, it's better than 97% of the American brewed IPAs I have tried. So good.Drinkability?

Can't wait to give this a try and see how it is. It just showed up for the first time at my store, so it should be pretty fresh. Poured into my oversized DFH snifter.A: A large 2 finger thick but large bubble head slowly dissolves, very slowly, leaving a nice lacing. It's very clear toasted auburn brown and orange color that's still pretty light in color. The head really does show no signs of disappearing.N: Wow, a big hop aroma hits you with this, as I hoped. Lots of heavy pine and citrus on this baby. I get a really fresh hop oil aroma that really makes me feel like I'm crushing fresh hops in my hands. Nice citrus, lots of grapefruit and tropical fruit aromas. I don't get much else on the aroma except lots of fresh earthy juicy hops and, well, nothing else.T: I'm getting excited in anticipation for the first sip that we may have another really awesome IPA at my finger tips. And the sip is really interesting, but definitely delivers. It's not as traditional hop taste with ridiculous bitterness, it actually starts with, well, fresh hop taste. I really get the taste like I'm chewing on a fresh hop, not even pellets. I get a very piney hop oil and some citrus, as well as grapefruit and tropical fruit overall. No malt character at all and not much for bitterness up front. A nice juicy hop character starts to emerge after a few sips with a slight grapefruit and tropical fruit taste. A touch of sweetness up front also helps.M: Sticky and oily like the hop oils. Pretty good carbonation to go with it.F: Here is the bitterness. It's not overbearing with the bitterness, but just right I think. It finishes pretty dry but doesn't rip the water right from the cells in your mouth as some do. I still have a fresh hop taste in my mouth like I just finished chewing on a hop flower right off the vine. I feel like I should be out on the harvest while drinking this delicious concoction. Then, surprisingly, the bitterness and hop flavors just disappear. My mouth is ready and awaiting for the next taste or endeavor. That is, until I swallow again and the salivary glands seem to excrete more hops, I think this has just absorbed into my blood and my body is sweating it out.Final thoughts: A great fresh hop taste IPA. I really can only describe it as biting on a fresh hop flower. It's gone some piney and slight citrus/tropical hop juice and lots of hop oil. No malt character. I can only describe the beer as a transport method for getting the fresh hop flowers from the vine to my taste buds and into my blood stream. I might have enjoyed a slight malt character with it, but this is a west coast style. I also love that it comes in a can. Tasty crack cans!

Tangerine, pineapple, oranges, grapefruit, floral, hints of pine. This has got to be the best IPA in Canada I've had to date, hands down. Light, sweet caramel is subtly overwhelmed (if that is possible) by floral and citrus hops, a nice, nasty (another paradox?) long hop bite full of pine finishes it off - and yet I don't feel like it was overly rough, a nice polite Canadian hop attack. Balanced and yet hopped up - a beer of paradoxes.Pretty damn fine, especially when compared to other bottled/canned Canadian options. Were I nearer to Vancouver this would by my go to. In a can makes it even more adaptable, good for wherever whenever. Canadian hop-heads would rejoice if it wasn't for our atrocious distribution system. Kudos to Central City for this.

A bit of resin and caramel(?). The aroma is unrelenting and is probably the best feature of this beer. An IPA cannot smell better.Taste: Not as bitter as i would have thought and that surprised me a little. Still, the taste is solid with some ripe mango, a reserved pine presence and a lip smacking finish. Some rind a little near the end like licking the peel of a lemon or lime and just a touch of spice.Mouthfeel: Quite smooth actually and not at all the hop bomb i thought it would be.

Thank you Central City Brewing.The aroma is strong citrus. As soon as you smell it you know you're in for a treat. It's fruity at the front end, and strong hops finish off the back end. It goes down smooth and leaves you wanting another. The growler is better suited to the beer than the can, but if all you can get is the can, it will only take away a fraction of the enjoyment.Jul 22, 2009"", ""A: Clear, amber-bronze with a white head, good retention & lacing.S: Big piny nose, with grass, tangerine & rind.T: Tangerine, pine, nectarine and citrus rind, with some underlying malty goodness (not sweet, just some quality malt protein). Certainly balanced to the bitter side, but it's not at all harsh with their soft water. Plenty of hop flavour here!M: Well attenuated, moderate body is smooth with a hint of hop acidity.D: A sessionable IPA for any hop lover.Jul 20, 2009"", ""Big thanks to my boy Jon for hooking me up with this can.Pours a clear amber, some orange, medium sized off white head forms, settles down to a thin ring around the glass, some lacing sticks.

Taste is similar, grapefruit and floral, some oranges, very citrusy IPA, dry biscuit malt and a touch of caramel/honey, balanced finish. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with medium carbonation, easy drinking. A good solid IPA, glad to see BC pumping good ones out. I'll try to grab some more when I'm back in BC.

So when I first grabbed the glass of Red Racer IPA for an initial sniff I thought, ""hmm, guess I didn\'t wash my hands very well, they reek of raw hops."" Turns out my hands were squeaky clean, it was the Red Racer!Ultra fresh, agressive pine notes are a tough thing to pull off properly, and Red Racer has done it flawlessly. This is about as hoppy as a single IPA can get without being an over the top mess. It\'s a straight up IPA, but there are lots of interesting hop flavours. I am very sad I only have the one can. More people need to know about this beer, it is easily the best IPA in Canada that has touched my lips!Thanks to Canucklehead for the can!May 30, 2009', 'OMG this is the best IPA in BC. Bigger and more fragrant than Hophead or Phillips. Incredibly balanced and hoppy as all hell. This is the one I have been waiting for since I started drinking IPAs in BC. Utterly brilliant and also in a can for bonus pointsApr 09, 2009', ""I've had this on tap and in growler...both are stellar and deserve the title of BC's best beer.Appearance: Copper-yellow with a small, lasting head.Smell: Verrry fragrant hops. You can almost smell the bitterness. A little grassy and definitely oily. A sourness comes through as well as a dark fruity malt richness.Taste: Bitter and oily. A little bit of a spicy character. Not as citrusy as some other highly hopped IPAs. Just plain hop juice. This is what I imagine hop tea would taste like. There is a little alcohol as well in the taste.Mouthfeel: Less carbonation than your average bottled IPA. Probably since this is a growler sample, but it's perfect. Extreme bitterness that goes unrivaled by other CDN IPAs. Dark, rich flavours pervade and a little bit of oiliness as well.Drinkability: Very high. Alcohol is too high to session, but a few pints(with a designated driver) would be perfect. Great bitter character that isn't oppressive and doesn't leave you bored either.Overall: Best IPA in BC? Yep! Can't get much better than this. Huge hop profile with strong malty richness to back it up. I'd love to try an Imperial version of this if the brewer was ever so inclined to make it :)Jul 13, 2008""]",https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/10321/49058/

Smells like it looks.Taste likewise is rich and complex. Vanilla, bourbon, oak, chocolate. Everything works together here really nicely. Nice cocoa bitterness is a relief, as nothing puts me off quite like an overly sweet imperial stout.Mouthfeel is spot on. Slick but not too heavy, not sticky or chewy. But also substantial.Overall I'm very impressed with this one. I'm not sure if I've had a beer from Driftwood before and, of course, this one is 8 years old, and has aged well. Would definitely seek this out again. Just about perfect for the style.Aug 01, 2020"", '15- Black Wax 12,2 abvAppearance : black. Black as black can be. Driftwood isn\'t kidding when they say it\'s a beer of ""infinite density"". This one was aged in prime cellar conditions, in a dark cool room, for 5 years. I was expecting great, I got better. The residual sugars are sticking to my glass. No head whatsoever. Just a thick black syrup full of magic.Smell : black, dark roast coffee, pure dark chocolate (think 99% cacao), caramel, bourbon, smoke. The alcohol has evaporated from the aging, I can tell from the sticky stuff on my glass. Some fresh cigar smell, burnt toast.Taste: like swallowing a black hole. Thick, liquorous, no carbonation. Not a dang bubble in there son. My head starts spinning straight away. Dang it\'s hot in here suddenly. It\'s like drinking liquid coffee beans. Not like a coffee, like if you could liquefy coffee beans themselves. The smokey flavor from the bourbon barrels hits like a ton of bricks. Not much alcohol taste, I was expecting more. Overall I\'m impressed. This is why I got into craft beer to begin with: Imperial Stouts.Jul 03, 2020', ""Pouring green-brown color, but opaque black in the glass. Formed very short dark tan head that quickly dropped down to a patchy skiff, leaving no lacing. Too dark to see any bubbles rising.Faint super dark malt, almost a tar scent. Builds up a touch of barnyard in the glass. Swirling the glass boosts the barnyard, but it takes on more of a cheese scent. Overall this has very little smell, even though it was poured close to room temperature.This is just over the edge of a malt that has been roasted too far. Somewhat bitter char flavor builds up. The sweet bourbon flavor rides over the top, smoothing over some of the char. Overall this tastes like a sweet toffee that has been forgotten on the stove while it was cooking. Somewhat harsh.Turns into a thick creamy foam of very fine bubbles. Some tongue tingling at first. The oily cream feeling persists to the end. After swallowing, my mouth is left tingling all over.This was a 2020 vintage. This is not something that can be drunk without major pauses. Each time it tastes much better when the mouth is fresh than after a second or third sip. My overall impression is that someone forgot about it at some point when it was roasting or cooking, and then tried to recover. Perhaps it will improve with some cellar time, but I wasn't impressed at this point in its life cycle.May 02, 2020"", 'Sampling a 2019 vintage, black wax, bottle says 10.3% ABV. Obtained in part of a swap with a local beer lover.The beer is poured into my snifter a deep cola brown to black coffee color with fizzy tan head of 1 cm foaming up. This fades quickly to nothing within less than a minute of the pour.Aroma is some dark fruit, roasted malt and charred wood mixing with a little brown sugar. Maybe a little tart fruit note as well, no hops and not really boozy.First sip reveals a lighter body than expected and slightly watery texture with very very fine and tingly carbonation. Was hoping for a bigger body for this beer.Flavor starts of with some roasted malt and a little charred wood, then some black licorice or anise notes and a bit of brown sugar and molasses comes through on the finish. Also a bit of wood dryness from the barrel comes through. No hops here either but I do get a bit of red grape or other darker fruit with a little bit of tartness, but not much. The roast and molasses dominates here. Surprisingly, I dont get any booze character with warming or black pepperiness and this beer goes down pretty smooth.A nice dark beer, not a great one, but not flawed either. Id like to try some other beers from the brewery too. This was a fine beer, but didnt blow me away.Mar 29, 2020', ""2020 vintage consumed within a week of broad release. Poured into a stemmed beer glass and consumed by the fire on a cool but dry winter evening in Vancouver.Pours cola brown with mahogany edges and light-medium viscosity, but appears jet black with medium viscosity in the glass on and on the swirl. Fantastic mocha head of tiny, compact bubbles that initially held up extremely well and then disappeared altogether. Some splotchy lacing.Initially smells more like an English porter than an RIP, very malt-heavy (natch), nutty, creamy, and grainy. Then I get notes of licorice, dark fruit, chocolate-covered-cherry, medium-roast coffee, and a twang of vanilla. Perhaps a little smoke, some definite oak, very faint toffee and lactose. It's an interesting mix, but it comes off as almost watered down, hence the porter comparison.Flavor profile has much more of a zing, with a surprisingly large hop presence to go with all the dark roast. Espresso, cream, fig, baker's chocolate, chocolate-covered cherry, berry jam, red grape, and miles of licorice up front. Piney, bitter hops alongside the dark roast coffee make for a strong smack of bitterness. Then there's an amazing zing of sweet vanilla, which drops in hard but fades out quickly. Smoke and ouzo on the back end, with a semi-sweet finish that rounds into astringent coffee grounds. It's a pretty fascinating journey, but the strong (almost burnt) black coffee at the end (which lingers forever and comes off as medicinal) just isn't my cup of tea and takes away from the overall experience pretty meaningfully. As the beer warms, the licorice comes out more and more, making for a pretty robust and dark punch of black coffee and licorice.Feel is soft but thin, though well-carbonated.I'm not a huge black licorice fan, and I prefer my stouts to have a little more chocolate and a little less coffee. So this isn't really up my alley. But to be fair, it's categorized as a Russian Imperial Stout, so my tasting grade is intended to honor alignment with the category versus my own personal preference. With that in mind, this is a good but not great RIP (or BA stout in general). I'm honestly disappointed and wonder if a little aging might do this beer some good.Feb 22, 2020"", ""Poured into a Fremont small snifter. 2019 vintage. Pours nearly black, appearing opaque black in the glass with a quarter finger dark khaki head that dissipates quickly to a small ring around the glass, slight lacing. Aroma of dark toasted malt with light char, milk chocolate, light vanilla, woody oak and a hint of bourbon. Flavor is dark toasted malt with moderate char and a little smokiness, bourbon, woody oak, touch of coffee and dark dried fruit. Nice charry, chocolate finish with residual bourbon. Medium bodied with light creaminess. A full flavored imperial stout with fine bourbon barrel character. The malt body is a bit on the light side for a Russian imperial stout, but is still supporting and flavorful. Pleasant char and chocolate notes. I was up in Canada picking up untried breweries, but couldn't pass this up from a favorite from north of the border. We used to get a few Driftwood styles in Seattle, but not for a while. Glad I grabbed this, it's one of their beers I've wanted to try for a long time.Nov 13, 2019"", '16 11.2%, black wax.Appearance of dark black with cabernet highlights. Alcohol, cocoa and light Cherrywood smoke on the nose. Taste of roast, frothy almonds, dark dried fig and a noticeable alcohol finish. A very nice beer but the alcohol finish is a bit rich, leaving it slightly imbalanced.Oct 13, 2019', ""19 bottlePours is completely opaque, even held up to the light the corners hold their edge with no creep. Decent little swell of light brown head settles down pretty quickly to little more than a floating patch that looks well on its way to dissipating as well. No lacing to speak of. A faint oily film when the light catches it just right. Nose gives a first impression of rich dark fruits and the smoky char of a beach side campfire when you wake up the next morning. Some roast emerges as it warms and the fruit fades. I'mma let it sit for a bit as I get the impression that it will continue to evolve as it warms. Coming back, this continues to be more mellow than I would have expected. I dig that. Not light, but definitely mellow. Some notes of coffee and an almost berryjuice rich component. The barrelling is expressed more in woodiness than in spice/vanilla/alcohol heat.Flavour continues the theme of mellow blended components with an initial kick of acrid coffee meeting a roasty middle character with again a light smokiness I hadn't really expected and a sweeter thread that is more fruit than chocolate. Rambles around a bit before coming back together in the finish with a quick dick punch of bitter/alcohol/coffee/and a weird high sweet note. Almost like green coffee vs darkly roasted beans?Thin body with bright effervescence and a finish that lingers very bitter and almost mildly tart. Alcohol is folded in wonderfully though.Overally I enjoyed this and I'm very glad to have grabbed it, but if Im' being honest, the beer I wanted this to be is a bit better than the beer this actually is. Still looking forward to the bottle I set aside in the 'cellar', though, to see how it transforms over time!EDIT: It definitely grows on me as it continues to warm, but the overall impressions remain largely the same.Apr 14, 2019"", 'Just had two 2019 bottles of this great offering.

The taste is gently roasted, bready and doughy caramel malt, a hint of biscuity toffee, semi-sweet, yet still aggressive Bourbon cask notes (dried vanilla pods, rye/corn whiskey, and musty wood), bittersweet chocolate, edgy cafe-au-lait, a fading melted anise candy character, and more hovering, and about to alight metallic booziness.The bubbles are fairly inert in their difficult to get excited about frothiness, the body a stoic medium-heavy weight, and mostly smooth and creamy, but for a loitering sense of tacky alcohol ingress. It finishes sweet, sure, and moderated to a certain degree by wood, generic fruit, and heat alike.Yeah, I probably cracked this one open a bit too early (but you never really know, eh, Tofor?), as the big ABV seems to have not yet found its sexy groove, instead evoking a somewhat scratchy persona. At any rate, that's judging this like a typically hyped-up whale, rather than on the merits I sense before me.

Not glass coating. Smell is subdued; bourbon notes (caramel, vanilla and a very distinct cinnamon note). Toffee and golden syrup come in later. No chocolate or roasted malt notes. No hop presence. Flavor is more of the same - intense bourbon, Jack Daniels-y, without a ton of heat. Still that cinnamon note with some vanilla panna cotta and flan. Great carbonation that gives it a very smooth, creamy feel. A very nice beer.Apr 27, 2014', '2014 bottle.Looks like a serious beer - deep red and gold highlighted blackSomewhat closed aroma at first, but opens up over half an hour or so as it warms in the glass. Dark and brooding. Burntness (with a touch of smoke, deep, almost industrial, or like a train station), molasses, a Scotch ale sort of maltiness, mild bourbon barrel, and hints of dark fruit like raisins or figs.Quite a bit more intensity on the palate than suggested by the aroma - bittersweet molasses, burnt caramel/sugar, dark chocolate, orange rind, bourbon, mild licorice. Starts fairly sweet, but finishes bitter and almost dry. Quite a long finish, impressive, with the flavors lingering for a minute or more. Powerful, and delicious.Medium-full bodied, fine carbonation, smooth texture. Noticeable alcohol, but quite drinkable for what it is.Good stuff. Thanks to the very helpful staff at 16th St Liquor in West Vancouver for the recommendation!Apr 27, 2014', ""I've been a fan of this seasonal from Driftwood for the last few years and I've been waiting impatiently for il's arrival. It didn't disappoint. What I do enjoy is this beer at fridge temp and room temp. (It's a sipping beer, not a sessional) Different flavours come forward as it warms.Rich, smooth and despite then high alcohol, it goes down without a burn.

There is a mild amount of roast and wood bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and smooth mouthfeel.

I smell vanilla from the barrels and other woody notes. The whiskey is apparent as well but not overdone. I get just a little bit of roast but not much. Not super complex, but interesting and enjoyable. It also has a fair bit of boozy heat. I get more roast than in the nose, but it's still gentle. There is some roasty, or maybe it's hoppy, bitterness as well, particularly on the back end. I don't notice the oak and vanilla as much as in the nose, but I do get more as it warms. Or the whiskey. But it is still quite good. Malty sweetness emerges more as it warms.Nicely carbonated, full body, medium viscosity with some bitterness leading into and lingering after the finish.This bottle has a year on it, and it strikes me as one that could have benefitted from some more time. There are a number of interesting elements in play including vanilla and other barrel characteristics such as the booze, malty sweetness, and roast.

Taste: Cocoa, sugar, bourbon, and vanilla open up into some hop bitterness and a vegetal note that is a bit off-putting. Mouthfeel: Slick, viscous, and a bit thin. Overall: This is a decent barrel-aged stout but I wouldn't seek it out or buy it again. The booze was poorly balanced/blended with the base beer and an unpleasant vegetal flavor seems to have developed.May 15, 2013"", ""Appearance: It has a nice jet black color to it.

To further the motif, I'm watching Alanis Morisette on Guitar Center Sessions. OK, only for a minute. 2013 batch, 22 oz. bottle, split with my wife. I like the bottle art, too. First, there's the David vs. the Goliath fight with the earth's crust, er. wax on the bottle. Six minutes later, I'm through, no blood shed, nothing splled or broken. The actual beer is very black, almost as still. Barrel rolls out as soon as the Red Sea of wax parts, but retreats fairly quickly. Big, bloody dark fruits are dominant, mild sweetness, barrel, & vanilla in the backseat. Singularity tastes like a bourbon aged in imperial stout barrels. Vanilla & straight-shot bourbon are prominent but not overwhelming in the opening bars, but own the afterburn. Numbs the gums like a good bourbon, & there's a healthy alcohol sting. Lots of dark fruit which I'm normally not fond of in this quantity in a stout, but it works here, playing off the alchohoool/bourbonity. Chocolate, scorched forest, licorice, more flame-licked wood. Light bitterness on the aftertaste. That licorice aftertaste - black licorice, unfortunately - is the only slightly unpleasant note. Tummy. Warming. Slowly. Trying. Drink. This is so close - so close - to being Gyff, instead it's Ruskin. It's also the rare beer that actually goes a bit downhill as it warms & the licorice begins to wrestle control from the barrel.

Bourbon barrel is evident, but it isn't dominant - it brings notes of vanilla and caramel.Palate: Rich brown sugar, vanilla, bittersweet chocolate. Heavy on the barrel, but without much heat.

Pours a light-absorbing blackened-brown colour. Thick. Nose offers little more than rich grain notes (like the darkest rye you can imagine) with some vanilla notes. This was aged in Maker's Mark barrels and the imparted booze matches well with a perfectly brewed RIS.

Anyway, this stuff pours a deep black-brown topped by a finger of sandy tan foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, mild cocoa, and very light vanilla bean.

Complex and engaging.Taste: surprisingly light (in a good way), despite the masively dark appearance and sky-high alcoholic content. The fruitiness is right at the fore, with plums and cherries and apples and pears; yes, even lighter fruits make it in here.

This one was the third round in the Great Canadian BA RIS Showdown against Half Pint's $ellout $tout and McAuslan's BA imperial stout. Good times! From a bomber into a snifterVintage: 2011APPEARANCE: A clear brown pour yields a one finger, medium thick looking, tan head with great retention, eventually settling to a nice wisp and leaving sheets of lacing down the top of the glass. Sits black in the glass with lower levels of visible carbonation. A splotchy wisp remains leaving some dots of lace down the sides. Solid head, but the body was a little light. SMELL: Roasted and caramel malts with some whisky and milk chocolate and vanilla as well. Some light sweet cream and dark chocolate show up a little later on as well. Milder nose, but nice enough. TASTE: Roasted malts and sweet cream up front, then some caramel sweetness and milk chocolate through the middle into a barrel and roasted finish. Whisky, oak, vanilla and milk chocolate with a roasted and burnt, charred base linger nicely on the palate. Flavorful and shows a nice balance between the base beer and the barrels, though it needs a little more boldness initially to put this one over the top. PALATE: Medium body and medium levels of carbonation. A little light on the palate unfortunately, but creamy enough, goes down fine and finishes slightly sticky. A touch of heat lingers on the palate. OVERALL: This was a solid beer for sure, with nice flavors from the base beer and barrel working well together, but it wasn't quite up to the level of some others in the style. The look was a little light coming off the pour and the body lacked the weight that's needed in this style. The flavor could also be a little bigger initially, even though it recovers well after the swallow. Although all three of the BA stouts we drank were great, this one finishes last in the Great Canadian BA RIS Showdown. Nevertheless, I'd gladly drink this again, and would recommend it to anyone interested in the style. Thanks again Rutager. Beers were awesome!Oct 03, 2012"", 'The pour is nearly black in color with a small khaki colored head. Plenty of roasted malt with a bit of coffee, chocolate, and bourbon.

Light pistachio aroma. Cola. Boozy and bourbony with time.Taste: Cocoa and roasted malt. One-dimensional but nice. Not much barrel character at all. Hides its alcohol very well, but doesn't coax too much flavor out of it. Smooth, tastes good, just not enough depth to jump from good to great.Mouthfeel: Medium bodied. Moderate carbonation. Not particularly dry or sugary. Overall: Good, but doesn't quite get there. Probably should have drank this 2~3 months ago when I received it, as some of the other reviews suggest to me that the balance and flavor were a lot better when it was fresher. Not too uncommon with barrel aged beers, I think.Either way, enjoyable of you like roasty stouts (I do).Jul 29, 2012"", ""A: Reddish dark brown to black body, with half finger head, you can actually lots of bubbles as well. Good amount of lacing. S: Bourbon (but not overpowering), vanilla, dark cherries maybe? some dark fruits, sweet malt, nice!T: Bourbon is not as strong in the taste as in the nose. Vanilla is also there but not as much. Not much chocolate or coffee either. Malt, little bit of hops, sweet caramel, some char. You can taste the alcohol, but not too overpowering. In a way, there is really no dominant ingredients in this beer. I wish it had more bourbon character to it though. I taste sweet caramel and malt the most. EDIT: so, I cheated and read the reviews by others and I agree with one person who wrote that they tasted Orange. It was some sweet fruit I was tasting, but I couldn't make out what it was. This beer kind of tastes like those chocolate that comes in a shape of orange... I cannot remember the name of it, but it has that orange flavor mixed in with the chocolate. This particular flavor comes across more when the beer is served colder. As it gets warmer, the beer tastes more like sweet caramel. Very interesting I would say!M: I think the body is a bit on the thin side for beer this big (but please note that I had Hunahpu last night... which happens to be one of the thickest beers I have ever had). Carbonation is also a bit higher than expected. Not much alcohol burn though. O: Very solid beer. At $19.99 (USD) though, price is very steep. Definitely worth a try, but not my favorite BA Stout.

Aroma, strong on the bitter, tart and alcohol notes, but yet, not really given its strength.Taste was good, the thin body made me think this had just outright liquor added to the barrel, rather than just getting its character from the barrel. Prime the pump. Heavy roast character, some bitter tart thing going on, interesting, different. Chocolate, licorice and vanilla. Really don't pick up oak or barrel as much as I do alcohol, but relative to its abv, its really not all that omniprescient. One of the best beers I've had from Canada.

Drank like any other stout with a splash of liquor... I found it tough to discern any quality barrels in there.

Spotty lace covers the glass.Smell: This beer is really roasty and got a moderate amount of bourbon in the nose. Getting some smokiness in it too. Taste: The beer starts of roasty and then it goes right into the barrel; something unique about this barrel flavor. You can get the oak and it almost seems like there is cedar in there too. I also get some chocolate and nuttiness from the malts. The beer finishes with a mild bitterness from the hops. A little bit grassy and I also taste cherrys in the aftertaste.Mouthfeel: Medium bodied beer with low end of moderate carbonation. The carbonation really breaks the thickness of this beer up. The carbonation is sort of pricky and surprisingly epervescent for a bourbon barrel beer. It does make the beer smooth and the beer drinks like its 9 or 10%. It got a little alcohol kick that is mostly warming and subtle. This beer would have been a 5 in mouthfeel if it was thicker. Overall: Really nice canadian beer. Its complex, balanced, and smooth.

Nose is bourbon right off the bat, some oak and vanilla as well. Digging way deeper I get a sense of some dark roasted coffee and a hint of the alcohol. Well hidden, although the barrel dominates the nostrils here. Taste is predominantly bourbon and oak, until midway through the palate some silky milk chocolate and vanilla comes through. Some sweetness and finishes with a coffee-like roastiness. Great, silky mouthfeel and real bourbon-y. Lots of the bourbon 'flavour' without burning like straight bourbon. Oak and some vanilla notes begin to almost overtake the bourbon as it reaches room temperature; two different beasts in this one. A great RIS overall, and we agreed that this would be awesome to have a bottle to sit on and see how it develops. Awesome.Apr 06, 2011"", ""Appearance: Completely black, with a small black tan head. Smell: Chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, coffee. An amazing smelling beer. Taste: Coffee, Chocolate, Bourbon, with a little vanilla. Mouth feel: Viscous, but not overly so.Drinkability: Dangerous. This beer is full of flavour, but not overly so. You can savour each sip and pick out something different every time. Overall: I have to agree with a previous review, this beer is like the Bourbon County Stout only a much more drinkable enjoyable version. I did really like the BCS, only I found it to be a little too strong/syrupy like. This beer has all the great characteristics of the BCS and none of the qualities I didn't like.Apr 03, 2011"", ""I love the BA guys out West, love their reviews. Ok, a rare bottled West beer they didn't send out to me already that's good. Volo:$46 with tax and tip, sharing with Jason. Its black and almost no head. Way too cold, half an hour into it as it warms I get a cask head, some trace of lace condensation on the side of the glass. A little boozy and chocolate aroma, and some strange spice in the finish that seems sour.Its closer to room temperature, and its very bourbon, some oak, carbonation is there.Smooth, buttery, as warmer and there is more coffee and coconut. 14% alcohol as rated by LCBO. Bourbon takes over as the smell. Chocolate in the sediment.Apr 02, 2011"", ""13 consumed 12Apr2015:Only a thin ring of head, showing some oxidation... 4.2.2012 Consumed 6Apr2015:Cellared incedibly well... 4.7.2011 Consumed 14Apr2017:After 6 years in the cellar, it has aged well. Still pours a little head, flavour has mellowed nicely. I don't think it would continue to improve, but it certainly hasn't went downhill.Original 2011 review:A: 4- Black with a tan head, thin ring of retention, leaves a bit of lace.S: 4.5 Alcohol & oak are readily apparent, brown sugar, molasses, great fruity esters, toffee, light spicing.T: 4.5 Caramelized raisins, piny hops, black-strap molasses, licorice, sponge toffee, bourbon & oak, roasted nut, candy floss, burnt caramel, assertive bitterness, alcohol on the cusp of becoming harsh.M: 4 Highly attenuated, light acidity and a strong, drying alcohol finish.D: 4 A sensational sipper.I was expecting more west-coast hopping, but this one's actually leaning towards a historic British brew (minus the bourbon).It's not harsh, but it'll be interesting to see how it cellars & mellows.Feb 12, 2011"", 'This beer looks like the goods with its all black label and silver foil plus the way cool name. Luckily the beer is world class ( well worth the $12) in that is delivers a barrel aged RIS that is muscular and complex but becomes focused and very drinkable as it warms up. Yes, this beer needs a few years in the cellar to truly meet its full potential but already this is amazing stuff that tastes of the wood but never forgets what makes a RIS so special. One of the best beers made in BC? Yes, and expect this release to be hyped in future as the reputation of Singularity increasesFeb 04, 2011', ""Amazing. Driftwood have never disappointed, and this is one more in a series of hits.Black with a thin, frothy head. Very clingy.Chocolate, wine, bourbon and sweet, candied fruits fill the nose. Dark chocolate and oak-aged bourbon abound in the taste. Very rich, very well-balanced. Even at 11.8% the alcohol is just a hint.Smooth, creamy with low carbonation. Very nice to drink. An RIS in the classical sense, but taken up a notch (or several). I've been waiting for Driftwood to do a stout and they've really come through on this.Jan 25, 2011"", ""Appearance: Completely black. Chocolate-coloured head with creamy, small bubbles that linger.Smell: Chocolate, vanilla, whiskey, coffee. This beer is quite exceptionally complex. Lots of dark flavours and the whiskey gives a slight alcohol aroma.Taste: A punch in the face of whiskey and coffee. The malt is sweet and the whiskey lends a nice vanilla flavour. The chocolate is a lot more subdued in the flavour.Mouthfeel: Extremely smooth and creamy. Slight prickliness from the alcohol burn.Drinkability: As high as it can be with a ridiculous 11.8% alc/vol. No more than 1 per night, otherwise this would catch up with you. Great sipping beer on a cool/wet Vancouver evening.Overall: This beer reminds me a lot of Goose Island Bourbon County Stout. This is a slightly less intense interpretation. But in my book, that is a good thing as the Goose Island was so overpowering that it was borderline undrinkable beyond &lt;6 oz samples. The Driftwood is definitely easier to drink and an extremely enjoyable Imperial Stout. Honestly, it's hard to find a bad Driftwood beer. These guys/gals are just so damned consistent in an incredibly varied portfolio of ale styles.Jan 19, 2011"", ""This is a brand new release from Driftwood. According to their website it is aged in bourbon barrels for 4 months prior to bottling. Oddly enough it came in a standard bomber, and not the custom Driftwood bottle. The beer pours a thick inky black with a fairly dark brown head that lingers in a viscous layer. Chocolate coffee and dark malt dominate the aroma at first, giving way to a ton of sweet bourbon. The flavor is rich and sweet upfront with plenty of dark chocolate, as well as some nice coffee and carmel notes. Dry oaky vanilla flavor creeps into the finish, which quickly becomes dominated by tons of sweet charred bourbon flavor. Astringency lingers in the aftertaste, and although there's no hiding the alcohol in a beer like this, it's fairly subdued for the strength. At $12 a bottle, this is way out of my normal price range, but for a beer that's spent 4 months in oak, I think the price is fairly well justified.Update for 2013 bottle: Even better than the last few years. Less oak, really well balanced and just a bit hot.Jan 17, 2011""]",https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/18858/65392/

The head was coarse medium sized bubbles that quickly shrunk down to a thin skiff, leaving only a tiny bit of lacing. A moderate flux of medium sized bubbles were rising from the bottom of the glass.Smells like a straw or hay with barnyard. A little bit of sweet, almost floral hops show up. Swirling the glass boosts the barnyard, but this is a much milder and sweeter barnyard than we were getting everywhere during the summer.Medium bitter flavors give way to a soft malt and the milder barnyard that showed up in the scent. The hop floral flavor shows up towards the end. The aftertaste is a boost in bitters and then all the flavors slowly tail off.Slowly foams up, but feels more like a soft drink. The foam is rather persistent as it turns to larger bubbles. Medium to heavy body in the liquid before it foams.I had this scored a full point higher when I tried it a couple of years ago, before the barnyard took over the local beer scene. At that time I described it as having a nutty scent with a little cheese, neither of which showed up this time around. It has a lighter bitterness level for an IPA. This seems more like a light American IPA than a NEIPA. Once the barnyard is eliminated, this would be a good basic IPA, but nothing really stands out.Dec 31, 2019', 'Poured into pint glass. Almost 3 finger foam. Exceptional head, white foamy goodness! Fruit, namely orange, appears on the first taste. This merges into a nice, crisp hoppy mouthfeel. Further smelling reveals yeast, wet grass, a touch of pine and a bit of spice. Ultra, ultra smooth BC version of an IPA beer. 7% abv but no alcohol or booziness taste is present on the swallow - just juicy citrus and a crisp hop finish.The smell is ridiculously inviting. If this beer is in your vicinity, grab it, horde it and most importantly, drink it. A tad pricier than some but, totally justified. This is a world class beer kids, grab it while it exists.Jun 01, 2019', '16 oz can into snifter. Pours a beautiful clear pale golden with 2 fingers white head.

Caramel malt is there, but let’s the fruity hops star. Earthy, spicy yeast ties it all together.Mouthfeel: Light to medium body with moderate but relatively soft carbonation.Overall: A wonderfully balanced and drinkable IPA that shows off some nice fruity hop and spicy yeast notes.Nov 22, 2018', '100th review!Appearance - Pours a golden amber with three fingers of frothy white head that leaves some excellent lacing. Smell - tropical and citrus hops, tropical fruits, mango, pineapple, passionfruit, orange peel, bready caramel malts, and wild earthy spicy yeast.Taste - Nice punch from the tropical and citrus hops followed by the tropical fruits (mango, pineapple, and passionfruit). The citrus flavour of orange peel comes through next followed by the bready caramel malts and earthy spicy yeast. Mouthfeel - Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Finishes sticky with a pleasant lingering bitterness from the hops.Overall - An excellent IPA that showcases the tropical and citrus hops very well. The wild earthy spicy yeast adds a pleasant layer of additional flavours. A true stand out of an IPA.Dec 16, 2017', ""Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a medium golden amber with a fine three finger white head that stays constantly renewed by carbonation and thick lacing. Looks great. Aroma of caramel malt, citrus and tropical fruit hops, orange citrus, mango, passionfruit and light pineapple. Flavor follows, with moderate caramel malt, citrus, piney and tropical fruit hops, orange and lemon citrus, mango, passionfruit, pine. Finishes with lingering resinous piney and citrus hops with residual mixed fruit esters. Medium bodied with nice medium creaminess and peppery carbonation. This was recommended to me by the staff at Whatcom Wine & Spirits as a limited, but excellent IPA. My goal that day was to get new (to me) breweries, but due to their enthusiasm and my previous experience with Driftwood (all good), I picked this up. They were right, this is a fine IPA. It has both NW piney and citrus character to the hops as well as nice tropical fruit notes. And it all comes together very nicely. It seems like there should be too much going on here, but I found that the tropical fruit dominates the beginning of the taste and the finish is quite piney with citrus notes. Really glad I stumbled on this one. Driftwood occasionally drifted into Seattle, but I haven't seen any in quite a while and I'm now sorry; I had good memories of their offerings and hope to see them again. A recommended IPA if you are lucky enough to run across it. Really nice graphics on the bottle too. The full monty.Oct 04, 2017"", 'This the best Brett/ faux-brett IPA I have had.The yeast amplifies the hop flavor and nose without becoming the main attraction. Fruity, dry and a balanced bitterness.Sep 30, 2017', ""0ml bottle poured into Sam Adams pint glass. Pours a clear honey yellow with two fat fingers of off-white head that leaves sudsy blobs of lace as it recedes.Smells of lemon and lime peel, diced pineapple, peach, orange, grapefruit, mild baking bread and pleasantly piney hops.Tastes of sweet brown bread, pineapple, peach, melon, zesty citrus oils and more resiny, leafy hops.Feels round and soft. Medium bodied with finely frothy carbonation. Finishes dry.Verdict: Highly recommended. More sourness would have pleased me, but there's nothing to complain about here.Oct 26, 2016"", 'Bottle: Poured a hazy orangey color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of mango and tropical fruit notes with some light funky yeasty flavours. Taste is a great mix of mango, tropical fruits with light funky flavours with a solid malt backbone and light residual sugar notes. Body is full with great carbonation. Great used of Equinox hops with yeast presence not as discernable as I had expected.Oct 24, 2016', 'Enjoyed very fresh. This beer looked great, with a golden color and just a tinge of haze. A small head appears on the pour, but breaks relatively quickly, and there is some lacing left as it goes down. The smell is pure hops goodness, with the tropical notes of pineapple and other fruits. Damn nice. The taste follows the nose, though there is a malt presence that gives the beer a nice balance. This beer was very refreshing with medium carbonation and a dryish finish. Overall, a very enjoyable beer that I wish I could get my hands on again. It went down easy, and quenched my thirst quite nicely.Oct 21, 2016', ""50ml bottle - very stoked to finally see this brew arrive in Alberta. Cuing up some 'Boots or Hearts' from da Hip: 'even babies raised by wolves they know exactly when they've been used'.This beer pours a slightly hazy, medium golden yellow colour, with three fingers of puffy, rocky, and chunky off-white head, which leaves some sparse sudsy cloud form lace around the glass as it lazily recedes.It smells of big pineapple, apricot, Ataulfo mango, and honeydew fleshy fruit, bready and doughy caramel malt, subtle sour and funky bacterial infection notes, and more relatively understated leafy and piney green hop bitters. The taste is gritty and grainy caramel malt, some biscuity toffee, a still heady mixed tropical fruitiness, some yeast that is more spicy than funky (fuckin' eh!), over-sugared black tea, and a growing piney and grassy verdant hoppiness.The carbonation is fairly tame in its workaday frothiness, the body a solid middleweight, and rather smooth, even the local yeast essence not messing about here - fancy that! It finishes off-dry, the tropical fruitiness waning somewhat, while the base malt keeps 'er right between the ditches.Overall, this one more than earns its place in the best of class, as far as Canadian brews go - they make a wild ale that is not particularly wild, so it still appeals to all those sour beer freaks out there, yet the rest of us can savour the lovely tropical fruit esters with which this is riddled. Normally, when it starts to fall apart, man it really falls apart (I know), but ain't none of that happenin' here!Oct 05, 2016"", 'Love the huge tropical aromas.

Moderate dissipation and gorgeous lines of lace clinging desperately to the glass as it mellows out. Rocky like bubble formations are left on the surface and stick around for quite a while.Aromatics: Hehehe, it’s been at least a decade since I’ve smelled some dank funky m.j. - and yet that was the first descriptor note I came across. And it isn’t even the dominant feature. Plenty of citrus fruit - grapefruit, lemon, and a little cactus nectar. Some indirect fragrance as well - sweeter tropical notes guava and mango. And all halo’d in a floral blanket. Sigh… this is what potpourri should smell like.Taste: Grapefruit bitter, with a honey-like tea and floral accompaniment. Some grasping tropical fruit flavours lose out to a pine resin overtone but strangely the usually super earthiness is kept at bay very nicely. A complex relationship is happening here and it reminds me of those old Bits n Bites commercial where no handful (mouthful) is the same. Feel: Slick and ‘oily’ middleweight. It feels so fluid and soft on the palate, the carbonation only giving nonchalant glances to the tastebuds as it all meanders by in a smooth and ethereal experience. Wow.Overall: Ahhh… this is what I like to see in an IPA. No wonder it is in our Top 100 Canada. Delicious and decadent, and surprisingly complex in its execution. Pairing : OMG… what do I put here. I didn’t intend to use this one for my Sunday Brunch, but I did so… keeping in the theme of brunch, how bout a delectable casserole - country chicken biscuits and gravy or a ham and cheese bake? A nice gourmet quiche would also suit this just fine. It definitely begs for a savoury partner. Given that it is only weeks away from Thanksgiving here in the great white north, I am willing to go so far as to suggest a pumpkin spice and pecan french toast - topped with some fresh apple, light syrup and powdered sugar! mmm…mmm…Sep 25, 2016', 'A:glowing Golden and effervescent (constant stream on micro bubblesS:Floral hop primary with a touch of tanginessT:lemon citrus notes very low bitternessM:a lingering feeling, coats the mouth almost creamyO: There is a reason this is a limited beer. it would be hard to compete with if it was available all the time.

Body is light copper and translucent.Smell: sesame seed and pepper coat pineapples, mandarin oranges and sharp mangoes. A hypnotic yeast and alcohol invigorates the edges of the aroma while tickling my nose and throat into a light giddiness. Dark syrups and resin wallow in the distant background from which purple bubble gum breezes ripple. When a puddle is left in the glass unacknowledged for a quarter of an hour its scent crumbles into cheese and sweat, which sounds unpleasant yet oddly isn't. Later neglected aromas are of ice and old festive candy and plums. Taste: A genuine replication of the aroma with the addition of amorphous perfume exhalations obscuring and infusing a long grapefruit bitter finish. Lemons and muted soaps greet the tongue. A toasted thin cracker studded with wild rice kernels corrals the experience. The long aftertaste eventually curls into tartness and grass.

Taste is much the same but packs a bigger wallop; bitter grapefruit, pine/resin, and a touch of earthiness as well. Mouthfeel is drying and bitter, body and carbonation are right on point.Overall, an absolutely delicious IPA. Not getting as much character from the wild yeast as I expected (actually, none at all really) but that's difficult to complain about when the resulting beer tastes this good.

Swirling the glass kicked up a stronger barnyard.Mostly vegetable hop flavor with a medium bitter level. It is actually quite bitter for an ESB. Half way through, a floral hop flavor pops up. Some malt underpinnings get stronger as it warms. There is a light barnyard throughout. The aftertaste is mostly the hops and bitter.Some light tongue tingling; more than would be expected from the visual carbonation level. Doesn't foam up much.This is much more like an IPA than an ESB, so not very true to style. My notes from a couple of years ago describe a floral hop scent and make no mention of the barnyard.

Maaaaassive soft pillowing head. As it languidly works back towards the liquid it concentrates into a powdery soft appearance and clings to the walls like spray in insulation. Nose is a nice balance of malts and hops... lightly bready and sweet caramel with maybe some spice and a bridge between all that and some earthy and lightly nectar-floral hops. Similar impression on the tongue. Toast and almost rye-like spice with toffee in a rich vein meet with a surprising amount of bitter earthy/grassy/floral hops. Big pine bitter finish. This is heavily hopped for the style, but that's warned on the label. You could make the argument that this could easily be a big midwest or west coast style basic IPA and I wouldn't argue, but it's labeled an ESB and it's damn delicious. Smoothe with appropriate carbonation and very easy to drink despite the big pine bitter ending.

The nose is a good indicator of the flavour, which is hoppy but very much balanced by a strong biscuit backbone. Mildly bitter. Medium bodied, moderately carbonated.

Mouthfeel - Medium bodied light to moderate carbonation. Finishes smooth with the hops lingering.Overall - A well crafted ESB. I was surprised with the nice bitterness from the hops in this brew.

Very good west coast bitter.Jun 18, 2016', 'I can tell from the first sip why this is rated so high on Beer Advocate\'s top 100 Canadian beers: it\'s awfully hoppy, and awfully ""West Coast"" for a traditionally English style ESB. I wonder about the style designation, in fact. Cloudy orange. Slight head that fades quickly. Some dank, piney flavours, maybe a bit of citrus pith, bitter black tea, and then big malt. Crystal, slight caramel. Bitter leafy greens, more tea in the taste, light biscuit. Low-moderate carbonation, but a fairly heavy body.A very well-made beer (as is everything Driftwood touches, if we\'re being honest), but not really in my own personal wheel-house. And arguably mischaracterized--this could just as easily be an English-style IPA as an ESB.Nov 06, 2015', 'Thanks to @Corson for this bottle!A dark orange poor with minimal head.

Notes of different types of citrus presented themselves.Aug 30, 2015', ""650ml bottle, always nice to have a mainstay in the Canada Top 100 just up and appear on the shelves of my local bottleshop of choice.This beer pours a clear, bright medium copper amber hue, with two pudgy fingers of puffy, loosely foamy, and rather fizzy ecru head, which leaves some patchy snow rime lace around the glass as it slowly sinks out of sight.It smells strongly of varied orchard fruit (orange, apple, and underripe plum), biscuity caramel malt, further tropical fruit notes, mild florals, and a prominent wet stoniness. The taste is bready, doughy caramel malt, a lesser biscuity graininess, white grapefruit and blood orange citrus rind, bitter pine needles, sharp earthy and floral hops, and a wee twinge of alcohol heat.The carbonation is quite frothy and fizzy, in equal and almost alternating parts, the body a decent middleweight, and generally smooth, those testy hops making a small dent here. It finishes well off-dry, the big grainy and caramelized malt still ably fending off that near IPA-esque hop incursion.A tasty and interesting example of the style - it's big and hoppy, sure, but with a certain complex maltiness that leans towards the old-world English bitter side of things, all while the hops scream out PAC-NW. Once again, this aptly suits a brewer from Victoria, given the nature of that city's location and demographics.Jun 30, 2015"", 'Big thanks to FondueVoodoo for the bottle.Pours a beautiful, slightly hazy, deep copper color with 2-3 fingers of off-white head, sudzy, with good retention and lacing.

An excellent example of the style.May 29, 2015', ""The first thing you notice from the beer is it's slightly opaque caramel colour. The opaqueness in part because of it's unfiltered nature. The citrus orange smell accents the obvious hop notes. These flavours come through on the taste as well as a balancing maltiness. The mouthfeel is slightly heavy and the bitterness lingers on the tongue. My overall impression is that this is a nice beer, however I was expecting a little more hoppy bitterness.

Clear burnt orange in color with medium carbonation evident. A faint half wisp remains and coats the sides of the glass with lacing. Very nice looking. SMELL: Pale malts, caramel, citrus lemon and grapefruit on the nose. Some pineapple and melon in there as well. Very fruity and hoppy for an ESB. Not quite to style, but it's still very nice. TASTE: Pale malts and some sweet caramel malts up front, then a nice dose of pineapple, melon, and some fruity flavors at the swallow. A nice bitterness arrives at the finish with grapefruit, lemon citrus flavors, and some floral hoppiness. Aftertaste is bold and persistent with plenty of hop bitterness, citrus flavors and a light melon sweetness for balance. This is more IPA than ESB, but still a wonderfully flavorful brew in itself. PALATE: Medium-fuller body with medium levels of carbonation. Quite creamy smooth on the palate, goes down smoth and finishes a touch dry. Nice feel for sure. OVERALL: Another quality, quality beer from Driftwood. It seems like these guys know how to do their hoppy stuff. The hop bill makes this more of an IPA than a true ESB, but the beer is fantastic regardless. I'd gladly drink this on a regular basis, so if you get the chance to try it, don't pass it up.

Reminds me of a highly hopped Fuller's ESB.Taste: Lots of malty sweetness and a slight English pub-ale flavour. Definitely picking up some biscuity malt as well as a ton of coastal hops (grapefruit, mango, lemon). Slight alcohol taste as well but it is well placed among all the other assertive flavours. Mouthfeel: Smooth and creamy as a solid, English-style ESB should be. I've had a lot of other North American interpretations on the style but mouthfeel is something most haven't been able to replicate from their English cousins. Driftwood does this incredibly well with Naughty Hildegard. Extremely pleasant to drink.Overall: The hops make this border on IPA territory but the malt keeps it firmly entrenched as the delicious ESB it is. As a close cousin to the Fat Tug IPA, this is a nice, smoother alternative for someone who craves hops, but doesn't want to be bitch slapped by them.Aug 19, 2012"", ""From notes accumulated since the birth of Zoe.Thanks to chickenm for this one.Poured from a 650ml. bottle, best before 111612.Appearance: Bright burnished copper, fairly clear.

No clear date coding that I can see on the glass or label. Poured into a pub glass, this brew appears a clear copper to amber color with a thick, frothy cap of yellowish stained head just shy of 2 fingers strong. Bubbles rise constantly through the body in support of the head which is composed of rather large bubbles. As the head slowly fades, it leaves thick patches of lacework on the glass.The smell of this brew is quite dank with hops. Other hop characteristics of flowers and light herbs come into play as well across a backing of toasty sweet malt. The sweet smelling character of the malt really makes the floral aspect of this brew's scent pop. Shoving the nose deeper inside my glass brings forth mild grassy scents and more herbal qualities to the hops that at times have a mild stinky cheese aspect to them. Overall a fantastic nose on this offering.The taste is malty sweet with a flavor of caramel malt meets lightly musty grains. There is a fruity aspect that evolves across the tongue before the bitter herbal quality of the hops come into play. There is quite a deep layering of hop flavors ranging from an initial floral sweet and fruity aspect that is mildly rind-like with hints of orange zest to a light catty aftertaste that is very herbal. There is also a dank aspect included in the flavor imparted by the hops which creates an interesting flavor combination with the light musty grain quality. The aftertaste is a mix of herbal quality that is very enjoyable. As this brew warms, a fusel tingle of alcohol becomes evident as well as more oil character of the hops emerge creating new, previously hidden flavors of resinous pine and a touch of a lemony aspect.This is a medium to light bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. It is easy drinking and super enjoyable. The alcohol is well integrated in this brew and it is very well balanced. Only after the beer starts pushing room temperature does the alcohol finally become evident with a fusel flavor and a warmth down the back of the throat. I am not an ESB connoisseur by any stretch, but I do enjoy them when given the opportunity. This one very well might be the best one I have tried to date. I keep thinking to myself that this seemingly over-hopped or super fresh example is along the same lines as Troegs and their Nugget Nectar. A beer in a style other than IPA that is hopped to such a degree that it has the aroma and taste of an IPA but not necessarily with the bitterness typical of the IPA style.

Earthy, herbal and spicy hops are prominent in the aroma, with a nice caramel maltiness. Hops are featured in the flavor as well, with more spicy and slightly citrusy hops.

It has a slight blackberry scent after it settled down again.Started off tasting like not much of anything then as it warmed up it had a fresh fruit and hop flavor that was quickly squashed by bitter barnyard. The aftertaste was mostly bitter barnyard.Relatively low carbonation, so it took a while to turn into a soft bubbled foam. Medium body with some astringency.My notes on this beer from a year ago make no mention of the barnyard smell and flavor. There is much more barnyard here than with the Nectarous.

Funky, fresh and rustic with some tropical juice dipped bread to hold it together. It looks like Orval's punk grandkid in the glass. The aroma is a journey through textures of aroma and is a sweet lead-in to the dry flavor which also runs through a lot of elements (earthy, honey, fermented juice with mold starting to grow on it, etc.). To top it all off it feels like drinking carbonated reddi-whip. I realize that I seem like I am gushing, and that I might be overstating how good it is, but this really does hit a lot of high points all over the board. It's well put-together, balanced, funky, hoppy, the pils malt and oats is a REALLY nice touch and gives it some wonderful body that it otherwise might not have... I could go on.

Peach is great but gives way to the funk of the Brett and the bitterness from the hops. All nicely blended flavour profile that commands another sip to delve deeper into nuances. Great beer. Could easily be a gateway beer Brett funk enjoyment zone. 4.20/5Jul 05, 2016', ""650 mL bottle obtained from the latest CANBIF - thanks Farees! Served lightly chilled.Pours a slightly hazy, medium gold colour, capped off with 1.5 fingers of creamy-looking foam. It dissipates steadily over the next couple of minutes, depositing a curtain of sponge print-patterned lacing as it recedes. A dense cap and generously-proportioned collar remain on top afterwards. Fruity hops on the nose; I'm getting mostly citrus, apricot and pineapple, with suggestions of mango, strawberry, pine resin, and Brett-derived funk.A very solid IPA; a modest backbone of doughy, bready pale malt and honey sweetness supports a big load of West Coast-style hoppage. Pine needles and resin come through with considerably more force than they did on the nose, in addition to notes of bitter grapefruit pith, apricot and pineapple. Subtly funky; it's noticeable, but Brett yeast flavours are definitely not the focus of the brew (at least, not until you get to the bottom fifth). Finishes with floral, grassy astringency that lingers on the palate. Fruity aftertaste with persistent hop bitterness. Medium in body, with light carbonation levels and a smooth, slick mouthfeel that coats the tongue after each sip. Final Grade: 4.23, an impressive A-. Juxtapose Wild IPA is almost a traditional West Coast IPA, but for one major twist - the Brett serves as a lovely complement to the piney, fruity hop bill. My only suggestion would be to amp up the Brett a little, because I am finding that the hops are kind of drowning out the funkier aspects of the flavour profile. Not a mind-blower, but I can understand how this one wormed its way onto the Canadian Top 100 - it's definitely a hophead pleaser, but with slightly more depth of flavour than your typical IPA.

Taste is the same with a touch of bitterness. All the flavors work well together. Moderate carbonation and mouthfeel. A very interesting beer.May 15, 2016', 'The ""wild"" part of Juxtapose Wild IPA manifests itself most obviously in the appearance; over-eager foam climbs up the glass as though it were running away from the bottle and the bottom portions come out looking like a combination of milk and sand. Still, this pulpy, opaque orange beer looks good.And it smells awesome! Brett enhances what was already an incredibly nectarous bouquet. Which qualities should be credited to the hops and which the yeast is a tough knot to entangle but this floral and ultra-fruity aroma is certainly, as the brewery put so elegantly, ""where orchards meet pastures"". Things get more intense on the palate; the tongue can appreciate bitter resins and barnyard-y earthiness not noticed by the nose. Still, Juxtapose tastes as though lemon and/or grapefruit juice was freshly squeezed into a chunky breakfast smoothie containing mango, pineapple, blood orange and yellow plum. Wild yeast adds a whole other dimension to the typical sunny, citrusy IPA - even if sourness isn\'t really part of it. Instead, it\'s notes of farmhouse notes of hay, orchard fruit skins and the zest of a thousand lemons (slight exaggeration) that breath extra life into those Columbus, Amarillo, and Simcoe hops. Not only are tropical hops and funky yeasts two of my favourite qualities, it also just so happens that they pair wonderfully together, each enhancing and complimenting the inherent characteristics of the other. Juxtapose Wild IPA is a beautifully crafted ale that I\'d want to have on-hand at all times.Mar 27, 2016', '650ml bottle poured into Sam Adams pint glass.Pours a slightly hazy golden yellow with four towering fingers of dense off-white head that leaves really cool lace as it recedes.

Whatever, eh?This beer pours a slightly hazy, yet bright medium golden yellow colour, with a teeming tower of puffy, densely foamy, and moderately creamy off-white head, which leaves some chunky snow rime lace in places around the glass as it slowly but surely sinks away.It smells of bready and doughy caramel malt, mixed domestic citrus fruit, underripe cantaloupe and honeydew, understated funky yeast, a subtle white pepper and scallion spiciness, and further leafy, weedy, and spruce tip-like hop bitters. The taste is gritty, grainy, and mildly crackery caramel malt, a hint of biscuity toffee, semi-sweet blood orange, key lime, and Texas red grapefruit, a lessened generic melon fruitiness, still muddled, but hard to ignore common spices, some coyly funky yeastiness, a tame hard water flintiness, and more leafy, weedy, and piney hoppiness.The carbonation is fairly low-key in its gentle and caressing frothiness, the body a solid middleweight, and not so surprisingly smooth, after having read the brewing ingredient list on the label - those flaked oats really earn their keep! It finishes off-dry, the base pale and caramel-tinged malt holding steady, while the fruitiness and funk continue their lazy spin around the (metaphorical!) drain.Like Nectarous before it, I wasn't initially quite taken by the hype, but in the end, the beer in front of me more than made up for my sardonic lack of faith in hearsay. A stellar wild yeast-treated IPA, insofar as the guest baddies don't interfere with the complex fruity and varied green hoppy goodness on display here. Awesome stuff, and am I ever glad that I have another glass of this to enjoy in peace.Feb 04, 2016"", 'Got this one from Rutger this past summer. Your boxes always rule the world man. Cheers!

Laces pretty well, though eventually it settles into a thick ring and film. Smell is pink grapefruit and honey - lots of sweet citrus, not much of the brettanomyces showing up at this point. Maybe just the slightest hint. Taste is a mix of more grapefruit citrus plus a light pine woodiness too. Underlying is a bed of acetic acid giving a clean, crisp, but gentle sourness to the body. No ""funk"" component that would probably bring down the bright citrus character anyway. Mouthfeel is crisp and lightly acidic with a very thin sappiness. Overall I\'m really, really pleased with this beer - the base IPA is wonderful and the brett\'s influence is subtle and only serves to benefit the base. The brett has a \'fresh\' taste to it, which is to say it doesn\'t add much in the way of complexity but it also keeps out of the bright and wonderful flavour\'s way too.Apr 09, 2014', 'A: Pours a golden apricot with 3 fingers of off-white head which quickly settles into a thin surface rim. Tiny streams of bubbles rise to the surface for some time after the pour. S: Hop forward with notes of citrus and musky fruits together with yeast, fresh cut grass and slight funkiness. T: Underripe stone fruit, citrus, musk, grass and yeast in the mouth followeded by mild funk. M: a Medium bodied with light carbonation. O: A very enjoyable take on an IPA. The Brett addition rounds out and mellows the hoppiness.

A half finger of foam for me, which receded rather quickly but kept a decent ring and some surface fuzz for most of it.Aromas: Fruity apple and pomaceous. Even some tropical notes of pineapple and papaya. Maybe a hint of cider (i.e. not quite a vinegar scent, and not really alcohol either.) Smells almost like a fresh orchard in bloom mixed with day old mashed apples.Taste: Pretty big flavour, still retains some that fruitiness but amongst the bitter of orange peel and some gently steeped pine needles. Slightly yeasty with warmed honey. Good stuff!Mouthfeel: Slick and somewhat warming, almost sticky which gives it a little extra weight, putting it at the mid to upper end of medium. The finish is dry, and there is a slight bitter linger at the back of the tongue.Overall: A really tasty 9% and 90IBU and doesn't come across as either of those. The sweetness is really nice and really does a great job of hoisting in the bitter, maybe even leaning it to a sweeter balance. Really great drinking beer.Pairing: With its lusciousness I want to hit it with a bit of spice - nothing outrageous, but a lightly curried India inspired sauce with chicken and some really fragrant jasmine rice. I think both of those will compliment and really pull out that extra bit of flavour.Oct 27, 2016"", ""Pours a hazy amber with a think slightly off white head. Great retention and lacing. Aroma is lead by onion with some light pine and a touch of malt sweetness in the background. Taste is hoppy up front with hints of onion, lemon, and pine followed with some biscuit and cracker flavors from the malt. Finished with some more piney earthy bitterness. There is a solid malt backbone and this is a hoppy but balanced 2xIPA. Moderate carbonation and mouthfeel fits the style. Overall, this isn't a hop bomb, like some 2xIPA, which is a good thing.May 09, 2016"", ""It poured an Amber colour with little head that dissipated quickly.

It was a good beer but it got old quick.May 01, 2016"", ""650 mL bottle from the LCBO; dated Dec 8 2015 and served slightly chilled.Pours a clear, vibrant amber-orange colour, generating one finger's worth of frothy, off white-coloured head. It lasts for a little over two minutes; a modest, foamy collar remains, along with some patchy lacing. Caramel, honey, bready malts and raisin butter tart on the nose, along with notes of grapefruit, pineapple juice, orange, dank pine resin and floral hops. Noticeably boozy, too; not a bad aroma, but nothing really stands out to me.Sweet, fruit-forward flavour profile that seems more well-balanced than this style is apt to be. Caramel and bready malts provide the backdrop, with fruity flavours of apricot, lychee, mango and pineapple following closely in tow. Big notes of pine resin, grapefruit and tangerine toward the back end, culminating in a surprisingly understated bittersweet, fruity aftertaste. Surprisingly restrained astringency for the stated 90 IBUs. Nearing full-bodied, with a creamy, smooth, generously-weighted mouthfeel augmented by light carbonation that gently agitates the palate. Final Grade: 4.15, an A-. Red Racer Imperial IPA is considered one of the best DIPAs in Canada, and for good reason - it's really delicious, while also being unexpectedly well-balanced and quaffable. While this isn't the freshest bottle in the world (thanks, LCBO), it's still drinking nicely, and has convinced me to pick up another (hopefully younger) bottle in the future, if given the opportunity. Oddly enough I think I prefer the regular Red Racer IPA, but this is still a truly solid Imperial version that all hopheads should seek out and try ASAP.Apr 21, 2016"", ""Appearance - This beer pours a window clear deep amber color and when I say clear, it is so clear it looks like a cut of an actual amber in my glass, It poured with 1 and a half fingers of off white head which faded leaving a ring. This looks pretty delicious.aroma - Big resiny nose, Pine stands out followed by grapefruit and lemon, Balanced out with light caramel and slightly stronger pale crackery malts. It smells a lot like a bigger version of their IPA which I guess is what they were going for!Taste - Mash Pine needles into a syrup and thats what hits your tongue first. Its followed by a more subdued grapefruit and very light lemon rinds. Honestly like I need to make a point on how sappy this beer is, the pine litterally tastes like evergreen sap! The beer is then balanced again backwards to the taste, the caramel malts seem stronger than the pale malts. but they are both there. Feel - The body is definitely a clear medium with sharp carbonation, It finishes very crisp and bitter, the feel goes really well with the flavor profile. Overall - This isn't my favorite Imperial/double and personally I think their IPA is better, with that said this is still a very good IIPA the flavors and aromas mesh well the feel is on point and it looks good. It just falls behind some of the best out there. So for the question of would I drink this again? yes absolutely!Apr 17, 2016"", 'Smell: very subdued, caramel, toffee, honey, malty.

A small thin layer of foam is poured and coalesces into a thin wispy froth.Smell - Big resiny hop aromas, pine with some grapefruit and lemon mixed in. Also a delicate sweetness of caramel lying in wait underneath. Some floral aspects as well, but more along the lines of citrus first and piney / resiny second.Taste - Hops and malts balance each other out quite nicely, whats left in the mouth is fairly bitter but with a melon and slight caramel sweetness. Only in the aftertaste does the big citrus flavors emerge.Bitter but not bitter, sweet but not too sweet, this is one of the most balanced DIPA's I've had, so while the flavor is less robust than I'd expect, this imperial IPA need to score well.Mouthfeel - Smooth and a bit syrupy but with a good amount of prickly carbonation to keep things everything. Body is fairly heavy and finish is dry.Overall - Red Racer Imperial IPA is certainly a fine beer, however as others have echoed, I prefer the simplicity and hop-attack that the original presents. There is some substantial balancing acts going on with this beer, but I figured that the flavor would be more assertive in one way or another (very hoppy, very malty, or explosive taste). While very good, it just misses the mark of greatness.Apr 12, 2016"", ""Look out, here comes the big guns. If you don't like high ABV or some kick-you-in-your-face hops, walk away.

Arrived in a stemmed glass, a dark reddish amber color like strong herbal tea with around an inch of beige foam. High, high expectations going in, as this brew\'s little brother Red Racer IPA is one of the best hoppy craft beers in Canada (my opinion of course ... I think I can back it up). Red Racer smells very floral and piney, and this beefed-up take follows suit nicely. What are really striking though, on both nose and palate, are the heady tropical fruit notes. I get a shit ton of lychee, mango, and papaya, along with some classic American hop gooseberry ""funk"" and orange breakfast crystals. Mellow pine resin, peach, pineapple, salt water taffy, bergamot orange like Earl Grey tea, tobacco flower, fruit roll-up ... All kinds of layers here. Many of these elements can be traced to Citra hops, applied with a lavish hand. Some orange peel flavor adds citric character but in all honesty this is one of the more perfumed and tropical DIPAs I\'ve had, with these components trumping the citrus and pine. The malts take a back seat to the hops but do provide some light toast and caramel flavors, just to remind you that this does indeed contain barley. As the tongue acclimatizes to the fruit flavors, more molasses and pine come through and a pleasant lingering bitterness emerges, almost medicinal like gin. Fairly fizzy but this somehow works, syrupy but smooth. Awesome and nearly beyond reproach. Maybe some will want more pine. This one is juicy and the booze is almost perfectly obfuscated. It is as if someone took Red Racer, kept much of the aggression, but rounded off some of the corners and layered on more tropical fruit.Feb 03, 2014', 'Pours a four finger off-white head that slowly fades leaving a very good lace. Crystal clear amber color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Pine hop nose and flavor is nice balance of pine hops and sweet fruit, higher ABV is hidden. Decent IIPA. $10.20 for a 22oz bottle from a Tully’s Beer & Wine Wells, ME.

Head retention is great, lasting solidly the entire glass and draping it with lace. The aroma is of pine and caramel with orangey hops and medicinal booze in the background. The taste is piney and floral hoppiness upfront with an immense malt profile with rum cake, field berry and cookie dough elements making for a complex flavor. Alcohol provides some heat and is always present as you would expect for 9%. The mouthfeel is full bodied and moderately high in carbonation. The finish is lightly bitter with a sherry-like malt character that lingers with alcohol heat in the back.This is a great DIPA that goes more for balance than pure hop delivery vehicle. Lots of malt complexity balances out the interesting piney/orangey hop profile. Definitely worth a try.Aug 08, 2013', ""50ml bottle, rebranded for the time being to benefit autism research, with 5 dollars per bottle going to said cause. The label's imagery sort of suggests that this beer is the 'missing piece(s) of the puzzle'.This beer pours a slightly hazy medium copper amber hue, with two fingers of puffy, foamy, and fairly bubbly ecru head, which leaves some nice gnarly, Sleepy Hollow forest lace around the glass as things progress southwards.It smells of acrid pine needles, bitter grapefruit and orange rind, sugary, toffee-like caramel malt, and more floral hops, that when combined with the lurking alcohol, get rather perfumed in nature. The taste is more big citrus peel extract and pine resin astringency, a bready caramel malt infused with brown sugar and tropical fruit - pineapple, lychee, and papaya come to mind - all further tempered by a soft field honey sweetness, and burgeoning alcohol warmth.The carbonation is more or less subdued, but not quite inert, the body a sticky, at times syrupy, and decidedly hefty medium-full weight, with a quivering smoothness that the tacky hops have the temerity to poke at. It finishes on the sweet side, as the bitter side of the hops collapses under the barrage of pudding-worthy malt and across the board fruitiness.A proper big brother simulacrum to the more famous Red Racer IPA, this offering duly amps everything up, all without losing the subtly and complexity that makes little bro so universally adored.

Initially a hint of something like licorice, which is odd, but works fine. Pine bitterness that lingers. Alcohol well hidden, but you can feel it pretty quick as you work through the bottle. Approaches syrupy, boozy as it warms up, so get at it while it still has some cool in it.An interesting, a bit off the beaten track, lots of complexities, subtleties. Worth a try.Jul 27, 2013', 'A great beer being sold in Ontario for a very good cause... An absolutely beautiful beer that pours a brilliant amber, with an oiliness and limited head suitable to its 9% ABV. Deep aroma of caramelized malted barley, suspended by the full spectrum of tropical fruits. Taste starts sweet before crossing that ""west coast"" hop variety and ending with an impressive bitterness; and hop tones that linger....A very impressive IIPA and the more we see from Central City in Ontario, the better!Jul 04, 2013', 'Picked up a bottle labeled as ""Imperial IPA for Autism,"" poured the beer into a true pint. The beer is a ruby-copper coloring, slightly hazed, with a filmy, sparse, surface coat of off-white head. Aromas of roasted caramel and toffee sweetness, with grapefruit tart and sweet, pine resin, and a floral highlight. Smells rich and robust. Flavors are malt forward, with a biscuit and butterscotch blast on the forward tongue, mango and pineapple fruit sweetness, and a pepper and basil spicing. Resiny hops presence at the mid-tongue, but overpowered by the fruit blend and malty backbone. Malt bomb in this glass...to the point of being unbalanced. The body is smooth and slick, supporting the flavors well. The aftertaste is cloying sweet of fruit and caramel, with the hops profile once again being outgunned. The finish is slick, with a sweet linger. This one started out strong, but spiraled a bit out of control/balance as it went along. At least the purchase was for a good cause...Jul 01, 2013', '0ml bottle poured into a mug.Labelled as ""Imperial IPA for Autism"". $5 from every bottle is being donated to charity. As Autism runs in my family this caught my attention. I reviewed this beer before knowing this was actually Red Racer DIPA.A - Poured a clear gold to copper with a thin beige head, head quickly reduced to a ring of bubbles, minimal lacing.S - Golden sugar, pine, grapefruit. Nice aroma.T - Some caramel sweetness, pine, grapefruit, alcohol is barely noticeable. Good balance between the malts & hops.M - Medium carbonation, medium-heavy body, sticky, slick, dryish finish with some heat.O - Considering the ABV the alcohol is well masked. Not the best DIPA I\'ve had but it\'s a pretty good one.Jun 24, 2013', ""Central City Imperial IPA has a dark, concentrated orange tone but sits aglow like embers of a fire. It is perfectly clear too, despite the rich, deep colour. Its head is fine but the lacing deposited is strong and found in abundance. Frankly, the beer appears exquisite and, rare though it is for a style so strong and bitter, it actually drinks as elegantly as it looks. The aroma isn't intense enough to call 'extravagant' considering the style is expected to smell flamboyantly, overwhelmingly hoppy. But it is majestic (and also somewhat distinct) in its own right. The combination of pine resins, pineapple juice, grapefruit soda, tangerine, lychee liqueur, wildflower honey and creamy caramel is utterly sublime. It's like reaching hop nirvana. The beer drinks like a giant fruit cup; syrup-soaked flavours of lychee, mango, tangerine, papaya, peach and pineapple are so big and vivid they feel fleshy. I really enjoy the spotlight of more uncommonly tasted fruits as opposed to the conventional grapefruit-and-orange profile (though there are elements of those too). The flavour turns deliciously bittersweet on the finish where it blends with notes of pine, creamy caramel and wildflower honey. Though it's commonplace (and expected) for DIPAs to taste reminiscent of fruits, few can actually emulate the sensation of drinking fruit juice in the way that this one does so remarkably. The texture is thick and pulpy, finished off by a refreshing burst of acidity. Again, I really appreciate the emphasis on tropical (as opposed to citric) fruits. This features the least conspicuous 9% alcohol and the least palpable 90 IBUs I've ever tasted. It is my opinion that Red Racer IPA is one of the best IPAs not only in Canada, but on the entire continent - the same can be said for Central City's Imperial IPA too. It has a certain refinement and dignity that is incomparable to most DIPAs. And the fact that more than half the costs of this bottle ($5) are going to autism research makes it an even more charismatic beer. BUY IT!Jun 17, 2013"", ""Stoked to finally try this one. Available now in the LCBO, labelled as Imperial IPA for Autism. A - Pours a nice hazy dark gold colour. Good carbonation. Two finger thick beige head. A wicked wall of lace remains with a good finger of retention.S - Big grapefruit, boozy pineapple, some pine. Really juicy citrus. T - Really nice grapefruit and pineapple again. A little bit of boozy syrup soaked fruits. Really solid. Mango juice and some serious maltiness for balance. It's balanced, but definitely let's the hops shine.M - Nearly chewy. Full bodied. Good carbonation. Wild pineapple, grapefruit bitterness in the finish. O/D - One of the best of the style made in Canada. I could drink lot's of this. Avoids being boozy and packs a giant hop punch without being too aggressive. Good stuff.Jun 17, 2013"", ""on-tap @ the breweryNice looking beer - bright clear amber with a health bit of head. A very well crafted and balanced DIPA that would likely draw a lot of criticism from American hop-dorks as this one doesn't bash you over the head with hops. Pine is fairly pronounced, caramel malt balance, some candied citrus. I enjoyed, but I think I prefer the Red Racer IPA more.Jun 17, 2013"", ""22oz Bottle from the Orleans LCBO for $9.50 ($5 towards charity according to the bottle)Appearance - Clear copper colour with an average size fizzy/frothy off-white coloured head.

There is also some grapefruit/pineapple fruity notes and a bit of a booziness. It ends with a quite bitter hoppy sweet aftertaste.Overall – It tastes like a beefed up version of their IPA.. which it should. A very good beer that is pretty drinkable given the high ABV.

Some malt sweetness is detectable but the hops are bursting from the glass.Taste/Mouthfeel: THe flavor is similar, lots of tropical notes, citrus, and peach. There is some pine as well. The bitterness upfront is smooth and the malt presence is somewhat sweet, adding to the tropical notes. I would not call it a sweet finish, it is more toward the drying side.Overall, a stellar DIPA, my favorite beer from Central City, which is saying a lot. If you are looking for a very citrus foward or tropical IPA, this would be a pretty good one, but be prepared as it may be difficult to tame with such a substantial bitterness.Jan 04, 2013', ""Got this one from Rutager this past summer. Cheers for the amazing box of happiness man! From a bomber into a snifterIBU: 90 APPEARANCE: Pours a small, medium looking, off-white head with good retention. Head recedes to a splotchy wisp and ring. Hazy burnt orange with slightly higher levels of carbonation. A faint, swirly wisp and ring remain but leave no real lacing down the glass. SMELL: Pale malts, honeydew melon, pineapple and tangerine fruitiness, as well as some light floral notes. Really like the fruit on this one. Bold enough as well. TASTE: Pale malts again, honeydew melon and some piney hops come out first. The flavors really come out nicely after the swallow as well, with pineapple, tangerine, sweet melon, as well as some bitter grapefruit and citrus lemon notes. Very fruity for sure. Some bitter piney hops and floral notes round it out, with just a hint of light sourness adding an interesting touch. Very flavorful, complex and interesting. A real treat from the west coast. PALATE: Medium body and medium carbonation. Creamy smooth on the palate, goes down smooth and finishes slightly mouth-coating and oily. Good feel that supports the flavors. OVERALL: This was really nice. A load of fruity flavors, nice aromas, and a creamy, oily body that supports it all. The light sour touch was a little different and that may have kept it from being a perfect score in flavor, but nevertheless, this was outstanding and I'd love to have a fresh bottling of this again at some point.

Poured into Chimay chalice. Poured a medium orange-amber color with a very low amount of off-white head that had low retention and no lacing.The aromas were very good, lots of pine, some weed, and a nicely grainy malt base. The taste was very, very good. The malt showed up a bit more and gave those bright and bold hops a good base to build on. The pine was most prominent, with the weed at the back and just a bit of citrus dryness at the finish.The body was nicely full and round without being heavy. It was relatively smooth for being so hoppy, a pleasant surprise, and the beer had a great finish. Drinkability was top-notch, this went down as easily as a big, hoppy IPA can.

Light film and a thick collar. Lots of malt in the nose, some biscuit. Hops are a little muted, but are mostly tropical in nature. Perhaps a bit of earthy/herbal as well. Taste is underwhelming to say the least, malty with a bitter citrus finish. Some orange and citrus wood cleaner, clementines and citrus zest. Sweet malty body, and almost comes across as a thinner American barleywine. Light booziness and medium low carbonation.

T - A big bitterness up front. Pine and some citrus and herbal flavours. The hop flavours don't come through as much as I would like but they are defintiely there. A huge sweet caramel malt backbone dominates and somewhat drowns out the hop profile. M - Medium to full body. Creamy. Light carbonation. O - This one didn't live up to the hype for me.

A mix of fresh pine needles and resin round out the scent.T: Hoppy bitterness pops in the front followed with the acrid pairing of grapefruit rind and fresh pine which adds a touch of earthiness. The alcohol is nearly undetectable. Malts and hints of vanilla are present which adds a good balance to the hops. Aftertaste of smooth grapefruit rind.M: Medium bodied with low carbonation.

The hop taste is complex and it comes in waves with the first sip quite different from the finish.M: Medium viscosity with a resiny feel and a medium level of carbonation.O: This is a hop bomb alright, and its drinkability is good. It seems a little more earthy than I remember it, but its still a great beer nonetheless.Edit: spoke with one of the brewers who said that more citra hops were used in this rendition of the Imperial IPA.

Lots of ripe grapefruit and pineapple hops that just tore through the air as soon as I leaned in to it. Huge notes of hops dominated the entire flavor as well. Sharp flavor here as the resin like hops took all the moisture out of my mouth and left me parched, dry and looking for more.

So you never know what you are going to get. I've had the Regular Red Racer though, and it has always made me smile, so I had high hopes for this big boy version. Poured thick and brashly building a amber and oak coloured beer with a thick opaque head. The beer was slightly murky with distinct burnt copper colour - I like! I looked big and bold, but raw and real at the same time. The nose was very nice, but not as unique or defined as I like. It was big and earthy with a punch of bitterness and hoppy must, but came off more bitter than aroma. I had a hard time trying to pinpoint the aromas, I got a waft of west coasty cascade, but not as fresh and citrusy as I prefer. They were nonetheless potent. The first sip kind of eased my concerns in a way. I got a bigger, more distinct hop punch that added rich earth, funky citrus, must (again), earth (again) and that slightly piny character I am used to from Simcoe hops. The malt was pretty thick bringing caramel and slightly darkened brown sugar along to balance out the hops. I tired to dig in for more malt, but the bitterness is pretty bold, and overpowers the beer (appropriately so). Still, it left me looking for something, not sure what.

The nose is soft, dominated by tart cherries, some sourness, hints of sweetness and a bit of barnt funk. On the palate, the tart cherries and a touch of sweet malt roll through first, but the beer transitions into crisp tart, sourness. There is a nice oaky character and an overall crispness. The body is medium with nice carbonation making it smooth, light and refreshing. Overall, this is a very tasty brew! Very smooth and a nice balance of residual sweetness and tart, dry sourness. A very strong example of the style!May 30, 2014', ""This is easily my favorite Flanders Red outside of Rodenbach and I could probably drink it more regularly!

Depending on age, this will always effect various characteristics.---Appearance - Nothing special, but nice. Clearly filtered. Nice strong amber/ orange. Small amount of head. Doesn't last long.Smell - Delicious funk, sour cherries, lemon, sharp and cutting. Light brown sugar aroma, too. Slight clove layered in behind? Light breadiness, alcohol is a little heavy on the nose but not offensive.Taste - Sour yeast, sour dough, pears, lemon citrus, orange peel, subtle wood flavour, grassy, wheat on the finish, apples, candied orange peel, with a nice, crisp acidity. Plants and flower pedals. Clean, crisp and dry. Lots going on here. Impressive.Mouthfeel - Nice carbonation. This isn't seen in the appearance much, but can be detected by the tongue a lot more. This can be felt all throughout the mouth, but mainly the upper back portion, nearest the the throat. Quite nice.Overall - It really doesn't get much better than this. To be honest, I am quite surprised given I am a real Belgian enthusiast and many of these North American breweries never seem to usually nail sours. In fact, it reminds me of the Duchesse de Bourgogne, but more fruity and slightly less sour, yet is certainly not far removed. No joke, this is a perfectly balanced Flanders: sour, sweet tart cherries and a beautiful yeast strain.Feb 10, 2014"", ""This is a fresh bottle of the 2014 vintage. Drank less than a week after bottling. A: Murky auburn brown with red highlights, skim of dense light tan head. S: Grape must, sour cherries, muted sweetness, hint of tannins. T: Gentle and intertwined fruit and oak character. There is a sort of vegetal lactic acid thing going on that's not overly pleasant - I hope this will settle down with age. The sourness is dull rather than puckering or complex. M: Light and slightly fizzy - not much to report but suits the job. O: Not a home-run, at least not at this point. It's pretty good but I've definitely had a bunch of Flanders reds I've preferred.

Served in a taster glass.A - White foam settles to a thick collar, wispy patches, and minimal laced. Lightly hazed burnt orange body.S - Very sulfurous aroma, with some farmhouse funk. There's a mild vinegar character, as well as some fruity malts, and a bit of grain, but this is overwhelmed by the brett and I'm not a huge fan of whatever strain was used.T - The taste is better, as the stale fart flavor has largely dissipated. Some oaky vanilla, overripe fruits, a touch of green apple skins, dirty funk, and some mild vinegar flavors. Not much in the way of residual vinous character from the wine barrels.M - Surprisingly zesty carbonation, and extremely dry and oaky. Medium body, with some light residual stickiness. Alcohol is well concealed and acidity is restrained.D - Not bad, other than the mildly off-putting aroma. Probably suffered being consumed next to Rodenbach's sublime Caractère Rouge, although it's not a very fair comparison as this doesn't have fruit in it. I'd be willing to try this again down the road to see if the sulfur clears up or the acidity intensifies.Aug 20, 2012"", ""50ml bottle poured into tulip 5/4/12A a redder shade of amber with a fair amount of haze, I needed to pour it right down the center of the glass to get a reaction but the thumbs width of creme colored foam leaves a thick ring of lace where it existed S funky oak comes out fast followed by some sour cherry and vinegar, just a little caramel and what I imagine fermented strawberries to smell like, more fruity funk and just the faintest hint of booze T oak soaked vinegar has less fruity and funky notes then the nose but everything just blends together to create a wonderful brew. well concealed booze and a little granny smith plays a part, fairly dry with some vinous notes throughout M sour but my mouth hasn't quite been turned inside-out, leaves my mouth watering and a slick feel on my cheeks, somehow a little sticky on the lips and could it be the pin prick bubbles leaving a slight tingle?

Kudos to Nigel at Ladysmith Liquor Barn for effectively cellaring this one for me since the release date. A: Dark coppery, amber with an off-white head that dissipates quickly but leaves a disproportionate amount of lacing. S: Apple cider and barnyard funk, soft on the nose but still bold. Very appetizing. T: Very subtle with the fruity sourness - light and refreshing without coming off as weak. Cherries and apples on the palate, vinegar and funk on the finish. After 4+ months of cellaring, no hop character detected. M: Moderate body, not too heavy or light, with subdued acidity and average carbonation.

Tart, bitter finish, with a somewhat dry aftertaste. Not very hoppy at all, almost like eating a citrus fruit thats been rubbed on oak (if that makes sense).

The aroma is a blast of sweet fruity esters and tart, sour and funky. Just a bit of sweet caramel malt comes through in the flavor, the sourness comes in quickly. It's moderate but not overpowering, and quite pleasant. Some fruitiness pops up, but the finish remains sour. It's almost grapfruity, but in an entirely different way from hoppy beers. There is a red wine like character, with some light oak flavors.I am a novice to sour beers, so I can't describe all the flavors, but I really like what's going on.

There is no vintage on this label, unlike the one in the picture that is a 2008. This bottle says 14% unlike the 11.6% referenced here.Pours a dark amber color. The head didn't stay on it. Aroma of malty but bitter caramel and hops. Taste took on those amber waves of grain and caramel and pushed a grapefruit rind bitterness. Slight dallop of prune on it. Mouth feel is full of the alcohol. Bitter C hops. Slightly lower than average carbonation. Plenty of stickiness to it, slightly viscous for a barleywine even. Takes on some darker bread toastiness later on. For me the significant downside of this beer was the alcohol heat that really obscured attempts at discussing any nuance in this beer. Has elements of dark fruit, caramel, toffee and bittering hops through the entire experience, but the alcohol burn seems the most prominent thing about this beer.

No time for this to spend dwelling in my cellar, no-sirree!This beer pours a mostly clear, medium copper amber colour, with a teeming tower of puffy, loosely foamy, and somewhat bubbly ecru head, which leaves some random splatters of chunky lace around the glass as it slowly sinks away.It smells of semi-sweet, bready caramel malt, musty toffee, sharp piney esters, brown sugar, concentrated orange and white grapefruit citrus, and a bit of vinous alcohol heat. The taste is gritty and grainy caramel malt, a twinge of earthy yeast, complex light and honeyed orchard fruit (apples, pears, oranges, and red grapefruit, I guess), edgy pine resin, more dark syrupy sugar, and a further leafy, weedy, and grassy green hoppiness.The carbonation is adequate for the job at hand, manifesting in a trim and solid frothiness, the body a decent middleweight, and generally smooth, even with those prickly pine and testy boozy characters flitting about. It finishes on the sweet side, but in a running gun battle with the lingering hops and alcohol - ergo, s'all good, man.Overall, this is a pretty pleasant and agreeable barleywine for we unapologetic hop-heads out there - no char, no sour, no funk, no 'sessionability', just a big, brash malt monster, and its unholy bittering harem (bride? fuck that!).

Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation.

Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and citrus/floral hop notes; with great strength. Taste of big raisin, caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, toffee, orange peel, floral, grass, pine, herbal, and floral/toasted earthiness. Fair amount of floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, toffee, orange peel, floral, grass, pine, herbal, and floral/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice complexity and balance of dark/bready malt and citrus/floral/pine hop flavors; with a great sweetness/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a smooth and moderately slick/sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish.

Medium to full, lots of chew, oily. Big and mellow. Hops are faded a bit but the IBUs are still there.

A: Before even opening the bottle you can see this is very light for a barleywine, much lighter than years past. Poured in the glass, it's a shade darker than a double IPA with a deep golden hue. Head is cream coloured and not huge, reduces to trace amounts after a bit. Some lacing.S: Deep, resiny hops was my first reaction. Pine, sweet honeyed citrus. T: Big honey sweetness (like a sibling of caramel sweetness) with big, bright citrus and floral hops. Bitterness is all but eliminated by the sweet malt body and alcohol. The alcohol itself isn't really that noticable despite the 11.6% ABV and fresh bottle. M: Creamy medium body with a fairly dry finish. O: I really love this new and completely different Old Cellar Dweller but it will disappoint the barleywine die-hards. It is not your typical barleywine, not by a mile! It's also so different than other Driftwood barleywines I've had. It's very much just a barrel aged DIPA, but a very good one. It's bright and sweet.Jan 01, 2014"", '012 Edition.

Body is full and while very bitter, there's enough sweet to round it off and just right carbonation to keep it lively.

For the second straight bottle I almost have to use a broadsword to remove the wax & get to the bottle cap. Why, why, why? It's an oxygen barrier, not a recreation of the Berlin Wall. Pour has a touch of carbonation, & looks like a horse track after a passing thundershower. Nose is quiet: caramel, toffee, sweet malts. Old Cellar Dweller is a boozy shot to the nether regions. Alcohol slips almost unnoticed down the throat, before stomping its warm boots all over the inside of my chest. There's some taste here too; lovely caramel & toffee. Brown sugar overload adds to the sweetness. Odd, nice, unfocused fruitiness lingers in the middle. Nice light hop bitterness at the end. My brain is starting to marinate. I like it.

S: Scent of fruit cake, deep malts, dark dried fruits of raisins, dates and currents and an alcohol ester similar to a dark rum. Some notes of acrid dark coffee and sweet from start to finish. T: The fruitcake taste is still there with rum raisins especially. Dark acrid coffee with deep dark toffee, not as sweet as the nose would suggest. Alcohol does show through - but that's reasonable at 12%. Really hangs on at the end with an acrid dry flavour that clings to the sides of the tongue. M: Burst of fizz at the front of the palate, with a pleasant coating throughout the drink that allows those flavours linger. Alcohol esters are vaporized, giving a small amount of heat. O: Great sipper that is best enjoyed slowly with great cheese, the saltiness allows the sweeter notes to develop. Would be great to try a vertical tasting of OCD vintages to see how it develops in the bottle.Dec 24, 2012"", ""11 vintageMy problem with barleywines is that they're generally too sweet and cloying, making them about as appealing as wearing a wet pair of underwear on a chilly winter evening. Admittedly, I'm not a barleywine connoisseur; I've had my fair share of them, but I don't really go out of my way to try them. I've had Thor's Hammer recently, which fit my previous description (sweet, cloying) to a tee and before that I've had releases from Stone, Rogue and North Coast most of which were pretty damn enjoyable, and in Rogue's case, sort of mouth-destroying. I don't mind that, though. I enjoy and respect a beer that can take me down in one bottle, which is why I guess I respect this style of beer.Old Cellar Dweller is probably the best barleywine I've had so far. This is obviously very subjective, but it hits all the right notes with me: it's dry as a bone, it's bitter as hell (100 IBUs) and it's insanely boozy (again, this is the 2011 version so it's 14%). It doesn't try to hide the booze, which doesn't really bother me. I'm not sure how you'd even begin to hide booze in beers over 12%, really.The taste is pure malty, roasty bitterness with a hint of sweetness in the aftertaste and maybe an even fainter hint of almond. The reason this beer is somewhat dangerous is that it's not cloying; it's surprisingly dry for being 14% and full-bodied, but given the circumstances, it's outright drinkable. Don't be fooled, however: this is a beer that should be shared between at least 2-3 people or to be enjoyed over a period of several hours, preferably with a nice medium to full-bodied cigar. Overall, I think this beer is fairly comparable to XS Old Crusty. It's probably a more ass-kicking beer (14% abv versus 11.2% or whatever Old Crusty is nowadays), and it has only 10 less IBUs than Old Crusty. It also is slightly more enjoyable in terms of mouthfeel and aftertaste. Old Crusty pretty much assaulted you with hops and burnt malt. This does almost the same thing but it feels... classier, somehow; more balanced. This is based on what I remember of Old Crusty, as I haven't had that beer in a couple years, so I may be talking out of my ass. Nonetheless, if you like Old Crusty or beers similar to it, you should give this a shot (if you can find it). It's a really impressive take on the style.Dec 24, 2012"", '010 Vintage.Beer is orange/caramel in colour, with a minimal white head that dissipates quickly.Smell contains caramel and bread, and seems sweet.

Sticky but fairly smooth. Overall, very good.Dec 16, 2012', 'A: Poured from a bottle into a snifter. A deep orangey-red with minimal head. S: When I poured it, there was a ton of citrusy/tropical fruits on the nose. Big grapefruit, orange, and pineapple. Smelled similar to an IPA. As it warmed up, however, the malt started to appear. Coupled with the fruitiness, there was caramel, toffee, and brown sugar.T: Right off the bat there is big bitter, fruity characteristics. Again, ver IPAish. Towards the back on the tongue emerged the malt character. That sweet toffee and brown sugar really made its presence felt towards the finish.M: Medium to full bodied. Creamy mouthfeel. I started drinking this beer probably seven minutes after taking it out of the fridge. It was super drinkable then. Once it began to really warm up, however, it got a little more boozy, and turned into more of a sipper. O: Definitely could have drank the whole bottle to myself (really tasty), but is better enjoyed when shared. Have another one that will be sitting in the cellar for a few years to see how this thing changes. Highly recommended.Oct 23, 2012', ""Thanks to MaxStout for sharing this one at jmgrub's tasting.

A ring remains until the end but leaves no real lacing down the glass. SMELL: Bold nose of caramel malts, linght melong aromas, piney hops and some spicy alcohol for sure. Bold stuff and quite nice. TASTE: Bold flavors again, following the nose nicely. Caramel malts and some melon sweetness up front, then a spicy booze kick at the swallow. Big and intense aftertaste of bitter floral hops, piney flavors, spicy booze and a touch of honeydew sweetness lingers nicely on the palate. Very bold flavors and increadibly balanced as well. Really, really good. PALATE: Medium body and medium levels of carbonation. Creamy on the palate, quite oily as well, goes down smooth with a burn at the swallow and finishes quite sticky on the palate. Heat lingers as well as a spicy dose of alcohol. OVERALL: Really flavorful and a creamy, oily palate as well. Bold and surprisingly balanced, this is a memorable beer for sure. Though the style is usually quite boozy, this one is perhaps a little too hot still and could use some time to mellow. It is excellent right now, but will probably be world shattering in a year.

Powerful grapefruit note and a blast of herbal hoppiness dominates. I'm getting ready for a big hop bite.t - Wow! Huge hop flavour, a rich malty backdrop serves to exalt the interplay of hops. i'm at a loss for words as to how to characterize the absolute forcefulness of grapefruit and apricot. So prominent, aggressive and palatially challenging. Unique for a barley wine, in that there are no detectable dark fruits (date, prune, raisin) that i've come to expect from a BW. This is all light fruit, married to a robust, peerless hop symphony. The hops are aggressive in flavour, but the bitterness is light, and just right. A boozy sweet alcoholic finish is the perfect conclusion. Very complex. Poetic, almost.m - perfect. there's no other way to describe it. The carbonation perfectly compliments the flavour explosion occurring in my mouth as this thick, thick beer hits the tongue.d - i would drink this every day if it wasn't $12 a bottle. Being from edmonton, I declare this brew the Yin to Alley Kat's Olde Deuteronomy's Yang. My god. Unbelievable.I would recommend drinking this at cellar room temperature - cool, but not cold. It's truly symphonic. Drink with dark chocolates and rich desserts, or all on its own. Tastes like it will definitely stand the test of time. Try it.Jan 02, 2011"", ""Edit: 2008 A year later, hops have died down to give a pleasing balance, carbonation doesn't distract, nice balance of roasty and caramel malts - very more-ish.

Bold, non-murky color with a fair amount of carbonation bubbles. Smell is hoppy with a hint of back sweetness, brown sugar with some hints of fruit.First sip - the hops nail you head on. Normally I am not a huge fan of high hops content beers but this one could be an exception. As it glides through the sweetness hits the back of the mouth and there is some complex flavoring going on. As you drink it opens up and you taste the fruits, brandy, a hint of nut.Still perhaps a little too carbonated for my tastes but this is a nice contender for a new brewery. Definitely going to have to try some of their other offerings.Nov 30, 2009"", ' oz foiled bottle, I think bobsy cracked this one at our barleywine tasting.Pours a mostly clear reddish amber, nice colour, big and thick off white head forms, settles down to a very thick layer and ring, tons of lace sticks to the glass.Smell is really nice, citrus and grapefruit hoppiness, tons of caramel, alcohol, dark fruit, earthy, very pungent hops, toffee and biscuit, big malt and big hops, delicious.Taste is similar, toffee, biscuit, raisin, brown sugar sweetness, grapefruit, alcohol, pine, spicy and herbal bitterness, huge malty middle, great balance. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with low to medium carbonation, some warmth going down. This is a fine barleywine, maybe the best example of an American barleywine made in Canada.

The hops come through strong on the first sip. They are slightly piny and fruity with an emphasis on grapefruit, and the bitterness they deliver is substantial. Brown sugar and dark fruit provide some sweetness and help craft a delicate balance. Medium bodied and carbonated.I liked this one a lot.

Very low hop profile.

The taste is rather sweet caramel/toffee/treacle malt, more baked demerara sugar, orange juice concentrate, pithy red grapefruit, macerated prunes, chocolate-covered cherries, a slightly yeasty mustiness, some strange earthy nuts, and more herbal and leafy green hoppiness, with that lurking alcohol a brick wrapped in old socks.The carbonation is fairly subdued in its seemingly put-upon frothiness, the body a solid medium-heavy weight, and mostly smooth, but for that weirdly bitter herbal and musty character lounging about like its Dad owns the place. It finishes sweet, but at least in a more or less moderated sense - all that caramel and friends facing some duly lingering hoppy, musty, and dry martini offsets.Well, Thor's Hammer is indeed one solid-ass thwack across the palate - lots of robust and complex flavours abounding, and with a morphing 23-proof alcohol measure that seems more in league with Loki.

Pours a dull mahogany hue with a hazy clarity and a sudsy head that immediately disperses into a tight ring around the shoulders. Nose expresses ethanol, wood and prunes with vinous notes on the end. Taste isn't too bad - a bit dull, but less caustic than suggested by the nose with the addition of burnt sugar notes which follow the vinous/acidic figgy/pruney character. Mouthfeel is a bit thin for the style. Light-medium in body with a slight acidity and an almost still carbonation. Finishes with just a kiss of residual heat. Overall, I have to say that I did enjoy this beer. It doesn't have the punch in the face flavor that a JW Lees puts out, but it's drinkable without being cloying while still getting it's point across. Alcohol is extremely well-hidden as well.

Toffee abounds, toast, dark plums, caramel, a nip of cocoa, a hint of earthy woodiness but not the normal accompanying dryness, bit of booze in the finish. Silky thick mouthfeel.

Smell's of a combination of brown butter and toffee, very sweet and warming aroma with a slight alcohol small in the background.On the palate it starts of with the sweet toffee and butter notes that dominate the nose but has a sneaky amount of bitter hop presence that comes in mid palate and lingers on the finish. Not an overly citric or piney hop flavour just a faint amount of spice and good bitterness to balance out the sweetness of the beer otherwise.Has a rich buttery mouthfeel with no carbonation and good weight. Carries the acohol fairly well but you are still aware it is there especially in the finish.Fairly drinkable barley wine but it really made me wonder two things; 1. what would this have been like 6 months ago? and 2.

A cloudy dark reddish orange with a finger or so of creamy off-white head that breaks down slowly into some rich lacing. Robust fruity/floral aroma of mango, guava, pineapple, orange, grapefruit, tangerine, peaches, lychee. Tropical and citrus in approximately equal measure. Mosaic is always a wonderful choice for a single hop ale. Dank, rank (but not overly so), bitter yet clean. I get some added lime on the palate in addition to the fruit bowl mentioned above. Some taste blueberry with Mosaic hops, which is perhaps shorthand for an amalgam of tropical/citrus notes. I am indeed getting this here as well ... Almost a sour flavor but unlike the more expected citrus. I can taste the ABV as well although not unpleasantly so. The tropical and citrus flavors are so big that it is difficult to discern the malt, which many consider appropriate for this style. No character malts in here, in any case. Rather medium bodied, not overly thick or heavy. Fizzier than expected but if anything this just potentiates the fruitiness. Some pine resin and green leaf emerge over time but the finish is strikingly clean. As the beer warms, pepper and coriander spice notes emerge (rather like a spicy orange creamsickle!). Nice approach to a high calibre no frills single hop DIPA, with the complex hop aromas and flavors left naked to shine.Oct 27, 2014', ""50ml bottle - the last P49 review of mine semi-joked about how many different IPAs they put out - time to shut my fool mouth, as it isn't doing any good, especially for me! Oh - one other thing - I reckon that I've never seen a more unseemly truth on a side label's opening rumination for such a style - 'look into my eyes - you are getting sleepy, very sleepy.'This beer pours a slightly hazy, medium copper amber hue, with three fingers of puffy, bubbly, and rocky tan head, which leaves a stellar array of layered chain cog lace around the glass as it lazily recedes.It smells of dank (natch!) wet forest petrichor, musty orange and grapefruit citrus flesh, hints of mint-tinged wintergreen, bready caramel malt, white chalk, lesser generic tropical fruit notes, and further leafy, floral, and certainly perfumed hops. The taste is a redux of that green forest floor essence, one somewhat reduced in funky dankness, and given over to an increase in fleshy south-seas fruitiness - pineapple, guava, and mango, for starters - some unheralded grainy, bready, and fairly sturdy caramel/toffee malt sweetness, and a cadre of pedestrian lemon/lime notes that seem a bit underdressed for this shindig - maybe they're here to coddle and chaperone the still well-behaved 17-proof booze.The carbonation is fairly low-key in its meek frothiness, but generally supportive all the same, the body a stoic medium-heavy weight, and way more smooth than I would have opined at initial hop contact. It finishes off-dry, the bready caramel malt calling time, yet sort of futilely, as those hovering Mosaic hop esters just won't go the fuck to sleep.Another immensely enjoyable and well-rendered single-hop IPA (oh, right, a DIPA), all from the good graces of a single hop strain. These sorts of affairs are getting more and more rounded and drinkable since one of those (in)famous Danish twins carried out their broad IPA experiment a few years back. So, we now lay in the afterglow of that, and, I gotta say, the layin' is certainly swell.Aug 25, 2014"", ""Poured from a bomber into a tree brewing tulip glass. Warmed slightly on the counter for about 15 minutes.Appearance: Poured a brilliant medium to deep amber with plenty of orange in the mix. I'd give an SRM value of about 14 to it. Quite opaque with plenty of suspended particles (yeast and perhaps hops) when held to the light. Beautiful off white head with quite fine bubbles that linger nicely. The head diminishes down to a nice little film across the top of the beer. Plenty of lacing left on the glass. Superb.Aroma: Incredibly refreshing notes of tropical fruit. The mosaic hops really have a distinctive aroma. Notes of mango and peaches, that dominate. Slight notes of citrus with orange and grapefruit pulling through. Light pine notes poking through as well. A tinge of alcohol but certainly not overpowering. Just the right amount of alcohol to add nicely to the character. Little to no malt in the nose present.Taste: Incredibly fruity. The bitterness takes somewhat of a backseat compared to the the enormous mango taste. Nevertheless, the bitterness certainly shines through gorgeously towards the end without being crushingly bitter. A nice amount of bitterness despite the high end of 86 IBU's. No yeast taste present but the malts kick in with a slight sweetness to the beer. A slight amount of alcohol on the dry finish. This alcohol adds immensely to the character profile of the beer.Mouthfeel: A pleasant, medium bodied beer. It falls right in the middle and doesn't overwhelm the taster with thickness. Light enough to want to drink plenty but heavy enough to give substance to the beer. Wonderful carbonation that doesn't dominate the mouthfeel that I find most Belgian beers do. Not too much; just the way I like it. A nice dry, finish.Overall: A fabulous beer from Parallel 49. Certainly one of their best along with their Russian Imperial Stout, Vow of Silence and Gypsy Tears (still haven't tried From East Van with Love yet, but soon enough).

Well done Graham.May 14, 2013', ""This is Parallel 49's first anniversary ale, a double IPA utilizing a single hop: Mosaic. The packaging is pretty sweet, it comes with free 3D (cyan/magenta) glasses so that you can fully admire (and be mesmerized by) the label, which claims that the beer has 86 IBUs and weighs in at a respectable 8.5% ABV.Pour is a cloudy amber with an ample off-white head and moderate lacing on the glass. Smell is pretty goddamn delicious, reminding me of Lagunitas Sucks: ripe tropical fruit and grapefruit rind. Taste is almost exactly like the smell: ripe tropical fruit and grapefruit rind, although I'm also detecting some overripe apricot and peach flavors in there. It's initially sweeter than I'd expect, but it manages to hold its balance quite nicely: it doesn't end up being cloying or even malty in the aftertaste. Also, don't get me wrong, this beer is HOPPY. The flavors I just described, that's just what the hops tasted like. Anyway, it's amazingly well balanced. It ends up being insanely drinkable for an ABV of 8.5%.Overall, this is one of the finest offerings of the style in BC. I seriously hope Parallel 49 brewed a gigantic batch of this, because everyone needs to try it.

Swirling the glass kicked up a light barnyard and straw scent.Medium bitters with a light sweet and sour flavor. Mild floral and vegetable hop flavor. Light citrus flavor. The aftertaste is a fading citrus with the hop floral and bitters dominating.Strong carbonation caused some tongue tingling as most of the fluid turned into foam. Some oily feel.The light sour base is interesting for an American IPA - perhaps this should be re-styled as a NEIPA. The barnyard scent is on the edge of detracting. I would prefer that it was dialed back a bit.Feb 29, 2020', 'Orange-gold juice coloring, fully opaque, non-turbid. Soapy bright white head of compact, multi-sized bubbles with solid retention and spotty lacing.Incredibly dank and juicy on the nose, with citrus, stone fruit, mango, marijuana, green onion, overripe grapes, and grass clippings. Smells wonderful, and the dank hemp note gives it some real depth. Pretty fascinating and doesn\'t really fit into a specific American IPA sub-category (hazy, West Coast, East Coast, etc). Really an interesting conglomeration of all of them.Taste profile is similarly nuanced but not as harmonious, though some of that could be because of an aged can (I don\'t know how old the beer is). The strong dankness remains, but bleeds immediately into overripe peach, grape, berry, and cantaloupe. A little pine and biscuity malt, grapefruit and nectarine towards the back, a little bit of candied fruit residual sweetness at the end, that quickly drops off into a fairly dry and pithy finish. Pretty different and interesting for a ""flagship"" beer, and highly drinkable. Maybe a little heavy on the stone fruit (and overripe fruit in general) for my tastes.Soft and silky with a nice prickle on the tongue, but a touch thin. Nicely carbonated.

I had thought this was a hybrid, American IPA and New England IPA due to the sweetness and haze factor.Appearance - murky and turbid bright orange gold color with some sediment that pours into the glass. An impressive two finger head is poured and that sticks around for a while. Did I mention that this stacks up well with many of the super hazy NEIPAs?Smell - lots of tropical fruit, orange, passion fruit and pineapple most prominently and a host of other citrus focused fruits. Well rounded and inviting.Taste - matches the nose, while there is plenty of bitterness, it is accompanied by juicy fruity flavors of orange, tangerine and grapefruit and pineapple, with suggestions of melon too.Mouthfeel - medium-light carbonation, easy drinking but sticky body.Overall - just a really well done IPA, that stacks up well with some of the best Canada has to offer. There are better IPAs out there but the list of better IPAs is much shorter than the list of worse IPAs. Will likely pick up another couple while it's fresh and available. Yum!Mar 08, 2019"", ""A nice but way overrated IPA. Collective Arts brews circles around this. Still, it is a drinkable offering that you can buy with relative confidence.

Reviewed from notes.Pours a hazy, turbid golden-blonde colour, generating one finger of puffy, foamy white head that lingers for approximately three minutes. A frothy collar lasts on, framing a bubbly film upon the surface; decent lacing. Looks fine, though I could do without the big flakes of sediment. The aroma is fruity, approaching 'juicy' but never quite getting there - I'm sensing white grapefruit, passion fruit, peach, orange and pineapple, as well as some floral, resiny notes. Hints of caramelized malt sweetness also crop up - no real causes for complaint just yet.As solid a flagship as one could ask for. It does have a subtly grainy, slightly caramelized pale malt note in the background, but it's the hops that immediately steal the show - as they damn well should. Grapefruit and orange citrus figure in prominently, with gentler hints of passion fruit, pineapple and apricot developing by the midpoint of the sip. Finishes with some pithy, floral hops and a touch of resiny bitterness that persists briefly. Medium in body, with spritzy, assertive carbonation that prickles and prods the palate with vigour; smooth texture, good drinkability, and no sign of the 6.7%.Final Grade: 4.08, an A-. Hopheads the continent across should consider Steamworks' Flagship India Pale Ale to be well worth sampling, if they can find it. The turbid appearance (and use of oats) make me believe they were going for a New England IPA, but I'm not sure it's all the way there - the bitterness is a bit too noticeable, and its juiciness is borderline at best. Still, this one should blend in with the mid-to-upper tier Ontario IPA equivalents quite nicely, and deserves a temporary spot in my rotation (at least, while it's still fresh and/or in stock).Mar 01, 2019"", 'Steamworks Brewing Company ""Flagship India Pale Ale""16 oz can coded ""E178""; sampled on 7 February 2019$3.99 @ Roger Wilco, Pennsauken, NJNotes via stream of consciousness: Very nice label. The appearance is not so good. There are visible, fairly large, pieces of particulate in suspension, and it\'s quite cloudy. It looks muddy in fact. The body is a dark amber and the head is a yellowed off-white that\'s creamy and a finger-width thick. The aroma is malty, seemingly caramelish, and fruity. It doesn\'t seem hoppy though, and I think the fruitiness that\'s there might be from the yeast ... no, wait, there are some citrusy hops present but it\'s still NOT A GOOD START. On to the flavor, it\'s malty and caramelish as well. That\'s odd because the malts are listed on the label as ""Premium 2-Row, Caramalt, Carapils & Oat Malt"". Sure they\'ve listed ""caramalt"" but without any indication of how dark it was. Regardless, what I\'m tasting is actually oxidation. It\'s not quite to the ""paper and cardboard"" point but it\'s at the stage where it enhances the maltiness, particularly the caramel malt. The label also lists the hops as ""Mosaic, Galaxy & Citra"" but unless they\'re using only small amounts this beer is past its prime because I\'m not finding them. I can make out some of the fruitiness from the Mosaic, knowing what to look for, and some of the citrus from the Citra as well, but they\'re definitely faded. So I guess that\'s it, this review is basically over. I don\'t know why breweries don\'t use packaging or best-by dates, especially ones who are exporting, but whatever, they\'ll just have to reap what they\'ve sown. The mouthfeel is good, medium bodied and smooth despite an effervescent, fine-bubbled carbonation. I can imagine that this would be a great beer if it wasn\'t damaged but I\'d still have to question how closely it fits the NE IPA style. I\'ll have to find a fresher version of this.Review# 6,466Feb 07, 2019', ""If you like IPAs, you won't go wrong with this one.

This created just over a finger of dense, foamy, rocky, tawny head with good retention, leaving behind nice lacing in its wake. Color was a cloudy Yellow-Gold (SRM = 4 - 5). Nose smelled strongly of grapefruit citrus and lightly of tropical fruits. Hmm. Mouthfeel was medium. The taste was decent for this offshoot of the AIPA style. They did not allow either the caramel or the tropical fruit flavors to get out of CANtrol, but CANversely, it was not so bitter as to be undrinkable. The beer struck a nice balance between a burgeoning triumvirate of haze, tropical fruit & citrus, allowing each to kind of do its own thing. I still wish that NE AIPAs would become their own style, but until then, this was a decent example of its potential. Finish was dry, but not overly bitter. It was not bad, but one was satiating for me. YMMV.Jul 10, 2018', ""A sticky, chewy, hazy, delicious American IPA. All of those adjectives are understatements, except maybe sticky. It's sticky.

It\'s funny because the blend of Mosaic, Galaxy and Citra makes it feel that way, and it\'s great, I like sauerkraut and also it gives the beer a hint of ""sour""ness (by warming up Citra seems to doninate it more though). The taste isn\'t like that though, it it full on piney and slightly citrusy hops, followed by a spell of low medium bitterness that increases by the aftertaste. The blend is good I guess, the mixture of these hops takes a great aroma for granted.

The taste is bready and doughy caramel malt, more mixed exotic fruitiness, still extant cat pee esters, wet stone paths after a rainstorm, wayward citrus rind, and some edgy leafy, piney, and moderately perfumed floral verdant hoppiness.The carbonation is fairly even in its merely supportive frothiness, the body a so-so middleweight, and generally smooth, none of the pervasive hoppiness here of the lug-headed, palate-invasive type. It finishes trending dry, the malt bottoming out a bit, and the hops keeping the fruity party well fortified.Overall, this is a rather decent version of the style, with a few of the sexier 'new' world hops shaking their moneymakers for us here. That mentioned, it is more or less balanced, as said hops don't quite run away with it all.

Here\'s a tip to Steamworks: with that \'extra\' space on your label, you could show the bottling date. But I digress. So I was in a Vancouver liquor store, and was told this beer had just won ""Best Craft Beer in BC"". Great. Awards are nice. I picked up a 6pk for C$12 (like any suds in Canuckland, no bargain) Well, I guess my expectations were a bit higher than they should have been. Truly awful. Like a child was let loose in a hop room and just threw fistfuls into the mashtun. No discernible goal with this recipe. A generic hop bomb, without any nuance or taste goals. A confusing, vegetal mess.Not filtering beer is fine...I don\'t get put off over a few floaties. But this was utterly murky, NONE of it due to the typical culprit, yeast, best I could tell. In addition, there was a ton of web-like protein globs in the soup.I didn\'t finish the 12 oz bottle. So I go to return the unopened remainder at the BC government outlet. Wow. It was like asking for a marriage annulment from the Pope. What a terrible attitude towards customers instilled in unionized employees of a government monopoly.

As you drink it the foam laces quite nicely down the glass and the cloudiness remains in suspension, absent of any unpleasant looking gunk in the sometimes sinks to the bottom of hazy beers. The aroma is very tropical and fruity, featuring lemon, orange and grapefruit citrus notes mixed in with some passion fruit and pineapple sweetness floating on top of wisps of very light biscuit malt.Flavour: At first this beer shows off the slightest hint of biscuit malt before blasts of mandarin orange citrus notes attack your palate. In the middle it get super juicy, matching the fruit in the aroma and coming together in a Five Alike like tropical manner by showing off lemon citrus and passion fruit flavours accompanied by a medium body and mild pithy texture. Finally at the end, notes of tangerine are followed by a subtle but present grapefruit bitterness that leaves hints of pine resin in your throat on the aftertaste and makes you crave another sip.Overall Impression: It starts off strong as a NE IPA with a big juicy middle and hazy appearance, but finishes with just a touch of west coast flare in its soft, slightly bitter aftertaste. Even after about 6 weeks after release it seems to retain its flavour and has a good shelf life for the style, which is something I’ll continue to test with my remaining bottles.

Looks pretty dang nice for an unfiltered double IPA.Smell is kinda thin, slightly juicy/watermelon-y with just a whiff of something metallic lurking in the background. Taste is better, the watermelon comes through a lot more, along with some nice juicy fruitiness that I would normally associate with Brett yeast (though I don't know if it has Brett, there's no mention of it on the label). It's still a bit anemic, though. What doesn't feel anemic is the beta acid bitterness that accompanies the aftertaste. It's just a bit too heavy-handed to make this beer enjoyable to drink. I guess that's where the grapefruit comparisons on the label come from, but honestly, we're in the Year of Our Lord 2015. Hugely bitter dIPAs are so ten years ago, especially when the hop profile is too subtle and maybe even disparate from the aftertaste to properly balance the beer out.I dunno, overall this is a decent first attempt at a double IPA from Four Winds. I'm gonna cut them a bit of slack for that, although they have been known to make the occasional great IPA (Juxtapose). I just hope that they'll be able to dial some stuff in a bit more for their next batch - cut down on the beta acids and hopefully give it a slightly bolder hop profile, maybe do some additional dry-hopping or something. If you like (or tolerate) old-school dIPAs that are bitter as heck, I'd recommend you give this a shot. It's not a bad beer by any means. It just does nothing to differentiate itself from the glut of similar dIPAs out there (despite it being in the upper echelon of that category), and I've come to expect better of Four Winds.Feb 27, 2015""]",https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/32184/160184/

After 5 or so swigs, my toungue feels like it\'s been carpet-bombed by hops. And as for the hoppiness... it\'s kinda like a premature ejaculation: immediately satisfying self-absorption, but feeling awkward now... was that it?

The taste is gritty and grainy caramel malt, mint and some other weird earthy spice, muddled domestic and tropical citrus pith, and some headier (dual meaning implied) wet piney, leafy, spicy, and herbal hoppiness.The carbonation is quite robust in its gentle, but duly thorough frothiness, the body a solid medium-heavy weight, and mostly smooth, just a wee piney and boozy twin-gun edginess asking for a veritable salutation here. It finishes well off-dry, the caramel malt not going down that easily, while the complex (complicated?) fruity and green hoppy essences provide a continuing foil to it all.Yeah, I'm not sure what happened, as there is indeed a quality base DIPA here, sure, but a whole lot of (Rosie - oh stop it!) weird off-flavours seem to riddle the whole affair, which is more than a mild surprise coming from Driftwood.

Fantastic dry finish, nice carbonation, a little bit of warming as it goes down.Not terrible but with Driftwood most of us have come to expect something special, which this doesn't live up to.

The mosaic hops used this year are awesome with a ton of tropical fruit.Aug 22, 2011"", 'Best Before: 2/15/2012A: 1"" of tan coloured head that left a nice fine lacing over a reddish-brown-amber liquid with excellent clarity.S: Pine hops stand out the most with citrus hops and malt in the background.T: A bitter, pine hop bomb that begins soapy and has the finish of malt and citrus hops. The alcohol is present in the aftertaste.M: Medium to thin viscosity with a medium level of fine carbonation.O: Hop heads that are fans of high IBUs and pine hops will enjoy this Imperial IPA. It has a beautiful look and smell to it, but it doesn\'t hide the high alcohol content as well as some others. As this is a brand new beer, maybe it could benefit from some aging. I would like to buy another and revisit this beer again in a few months just before the best before date.Aug 19, 2011']",https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/18858/72267/

Lots of grapefruit peel and pine resin. Nice support from the caramel malts. Mouthfeel - Medium bodied with moderate carbonation.

Oh, and IPAs, yes, IPAs.This beer pours a clear, bright medium copper amber colour, with two fingers of puffy, rocky, and somewhat chunky ecru head, which leaves some sudsy exploding (is there any other kind - ed.) fireworks lace around the glass as things quickly dissolve.It smells of sort of dank pine resin, muddled tropical fruity notes, some prominent hard water flintiness, a gritty and grainy caramel malt backbone, and further leafy, earthy, and certainly perfumed floral green hop bitters. The taste is some rather edgy piney and leafy green hoppiness up front, crackery and grainy pale malt, a lessened caramel sweetness, still hard to ignore stone paths after the recent cold-ass autumn rain, more focused citrus rind fruitiness, and some not so subtle metallic booziness.The bubbles are adequate for the job at hand, via their sturdy frothiness, the body a so-so middleweight, and smooth by the same skewed metric - y'know, good if you only care about the hops, and not so much if you're expecting more. It finishes trending dry, the dank, piney, and herbal/floral thing really pushing the agenda.Overall, on a day where 'treats' are the very word, this IPA comes off as Daddy's little version of all those rockets, chocolates, and caramel whatsamathingies that I've had to hand out, and verily preserve from my toddlers' own stash this evening.

Even its foam has a life of its own - constantly regenerating itself and able to ascend up the glass even as the liquid beneath it depletes. It's a very solid looking IPA. Hops are in no short supply here. The aroma is wholly enveloped in scents of leafy greens and overripe fruits (we're talking a summer's crop worth of cantaloupe and just about any variety of citrus that comes to mind). It's a plump, concentrated, undiluted showcase of hops at their finest and most stinging. Although fairly stock by the smell of things, Play Dead is a somewhat distinctive IPA in taste; it's not just the customary pine or citrus flavours. No, this also has slightly offbeat notes of sauteed greens (think spinach) and a manifestly herbal quality that carries long into the finish like bitter medicine. The 6.8% alcohol is a little noticeable too. The 75 IBU not so much. I anticipated from both the appearance and aroma a much greater presence of malt; there is a trace of caramel but there's certainly no crunch. I've got to assume the recipe allocated for a little more toasty toffee flavour than this; more of those dark honey notes would accentuate the forest-y resins. If you ask me, IPAs are a man's best friends - for most craft beer drinkers hops elicit a kind of Pavlov's dogs effect. Though not over-the-top hoppy, Play Dead makes great companionship for those that prefer a more balanced example of the style for everyday drinking.

I think she was joking...This pint appears black, with some cola highlights at the base, and one finger of thin creamy beige head, which eventually leaves a spider web of lace around the glass. It smells of roasted malt, creamy grain, and earthy hops. The taste is soft roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate, cream (upon saying this to my gf, she tried it, and said ""hell yeah, that\'s creamy!), an echo of coffee, and earthy hops. The carbonation is quite mild, the body full, smooth, silky, and creamy, and it finishes off-dry, some caramel cream and dry chocolate persisting.A stellar dry stout, smooth and creamy, nicely balanced and drinkable - definitely the best I\'ve tried from Canada.Jul 02, 2010', ""I love the Dry Irish Stout style. I always find that they're heavy on the coffee taste/aroma that roasted malts impart. I don't even drink coffee. Back Hand of God is no exception. This cola looking beer has a strong coffee aroma with flecks of cocoa mingled in, and burnt bread. When supped this continues in one the smoothest, and slightly creamy, stouts you can imagine. There is a nice light hop presence through out that just adds even more to a beer that such big flavours at 5.2%. CAMRA Vancouver members have given this beer, and brewery, many awards and they're deserved. This is BC's best stout, and the best of the kind that I've had so far.Apr 07, 2010"", 'Pours a dark black color with no head. Nice roasted malt aroma. This is very tasty, with flavors of sweet chocolate, roasted malt, and coffee. Nice mouthfeel, medium-light body with a dry finish. Very drinkable, this would make a great session stout.Feb 27, 2010', ""On tap at Christie's Carriage House. Arrived with no head, dark dark black pint.Smell is light. Served WAY too cold! Warms to roasting malts, light hints of hops.Taste is a nice mixture of roasting malts, espresso, slight hints of hops in the finish. Light body but I tell myself that this is the style. Very drinkable. Great taste for the light ABV - one of the few good all organic beers out there. Delicious.May 09, 2009"", ""On tap...Alibi Room, Vancouver BC-March 1, 2009I got this in a round of 4 taster sized glasses. Take the appearance figure with a grain of salt since I didn't have a normal scale to view it at.Appearance: Poured a nice dark ruby red-black colour that laced on the glass with long lasting white head.Smell: Pretty normal, but with a bit of chocolate and coffee poking through on the second sniff.Taste: Oh wow. Great stuff. Incredible bitter sweet chocolate flavour in this one. Slight coffee tones as well.Mouthfeel: Quite creamy, little carbonation as wood be expected from an Irish Stout. Creamy and velvety. Quite a smooth sipper.Drinkability: I could drink lots of this if only it were less expensive on tap, or available in bottles at the local BCLDB. Overall: Great chocolaty stout worthy of a visit if you can find it on tap. I love the fact that it is all organic as well. More organic beers should live up to the standard that Crannog has set.Mar 01, 2009"", 'Alibi Room with Tigglmtl, and so a surprisingly good stout that is underated. Great roast coffee aroma. Creamy medium mouthfeel taste, very fresh (and the all the difference) and roasty coffee. Lacey on black. Above average carbonation.Oh, and hopped up.Feb 24, 2008', 'I tried this stout at a wine bar/restaurant in Oliver, BC It was served way to cold. I had to wait 20 minutes and hold my hands around the glass to get it up to the proper temp.It seemed a bit light for a stout, more like a dark porter. The head vanished very quickly with no trace of lace on the glass.The aroma was pleasant with a strong roast malt nose as I expected.I was pleasantly surprised that the flavor developed into a well balanced taste after my pint warmed up.Decent body and the carbonation seemed right on.I would have had another if I would have had enough time to let it warm up.Jan 23, 2007', ""Having had this fresh a number of times over the years, I'm updating my review. Certainly among the best dry stouts.Original review:I had this at Christies Carriage House in Victoria, BC. It paired nicely with their breaded oysters.A 2.5: Black, slight ruby tinge, NO HEAD!S 3: Fruity with a bit of roast malt.T 4: Fruity, pleasantly roasty (like a darker roasted coffee, but MUCH more balanced). It's a nicely balanced dry stout. Not a lot of depth to the flavour, but certainly a better flavour than most.M 3.5: Light to moderate body, Light carbonation, dry finish.D 4.5: Very drinkable. This could be a session stout for the masses.Dec 23, 2005"", 'This is the best stout made in B.C.. It is jet black and full of flavours suggesting chocolate, malt and burnt cake.

The head is lovely with a solid two finger thick foam layer covering the liquid and it is nice and dense....plenty of wee tight bubbles that maintain their composure and slowly settle down into a caramel colored thick layer. Lacing also appears to look good, as there is a good number of small sticky protein pockets clinging to the side of my glass!S- This has an interesting smell.....definitely sweeter than a normal Imperial Stout. Dark chocolate, coffee and burnt woody aromas give way to the molasses used in this, which brings a clever baked molasses cookie richness, as well as cashew/almond hints....like a burnt almond chocolate bar. The finish seems to linger, again being a mix of sweet and dry....caramel and/or dried fruits, yet Earth tones.T- This is good! It reminds me somewhat of a Milk Stout in terms of sweetness, but it has a yeasty/creamy character throughout the taste. Dark chocolate, creamy almond bark, mocha and slightly astringent blackstrap molasses sweetness are the main flavors, along with background notes of char, Earth, bittering cocoa, nuttiness, heavily toasted malts, vanilla bean, cooked brown sugar, and a sweet, turning into a quick bitter hop finish....this lingers on for a minute before another sip is in order!M/O- Medium-full bodied, I feel like there is something to chew on here! The carbonation is creamy smooth and as the appearance suggested, bubbles are in fact wee tight and really allow the flavors to come through on the palate! The alcohol is well hidden and the velvety feel makes this a highly drinkable Stout! I would be happy to enjoy this on any given night, and it really calms down the stomach after a big meal!

Fuller bodied with a smoothness that is almost oak/wood like and even comes across as creamy. There is a balance between roasted malts and bitter chocolate and some chocolate sweetness, a spicy sweetness which can be both the licorice and molasses and notes of dark fruits like figs, toffee and black cherry. Not a typical RIS or even regular imperial stout as the roasted/coffee malts and barley flavors are in background compared to sweeter aspects but overall it has some of that hefty dryness mixed with some different sweet flavors.Oct 09, 2015', 'Large shared bottle in Atlanta.

Somewhat classic, and very solid.May 04, 2013', ""Pothole Filler looks dark and thick enough to serve as exactly that; it's like someone poured tar into the glass. Normally, I wouldn't expect any head from a 9% beer in a flip-top bottle* but this is topped with a fluffy, deep-coloured foam that dresses the glass in designs reminiscent of a Banksy piece. This lacing could go on auction at Sotheby's. The aroma is heavy on the nose with notes of burnt malt, cocoa and molasses - somewhere an Italian man drinking an espresso is experiencing the same thing. Typically the more impressive and overwhelming a beer, the more adjectives and tasting notes are used to try to describe it. In this case, it's straightforward enough that just the three listed should suffice.The palate is a mouth-coating monument to roasted malt: coffee, dark chocolate, black cherry, smoke, pipe tobacco and a hint of clove are appreciated (in order of most to least). While the espresso and cocoa make up the vast majority of the flavour, they fall on brooding dark fruit and caramel notes. The tastebuds are kept occupied through the entire 1 liter. Beneath the heavy cocoa and burnt malt notes is a beer that is less aggressive than assumed. This imperial stout holds a firmly bitter structure but, perhaps owing to the molasses, drinks with an ultra-velvety mouthfeel and passes over the palate with ultimate smoothness. It has a dry, poised finish (with a hint of chopped mint, i.e., hops) that helps conceal its true strength. It be may a touch short of the best imperial stouts but Pothole Filler is every bit in the same vein and should be counted among Canada's best. While I didn't find myself doing back-flips over it, this is nonetheless absolutely what fans of the style should be on the lookout for. It won't have the biggest 'wow' factor but does provide everything else one could want.*while it has a flip-top, the bottle is actually capped.Mar 27, 2013"", ""A real nice stout.Poured in a clear pint glass.Nice dark brown / black appearance.The head was almost a smooth as a guinness yet more of a chocolate milk color.Thin lace on the glass as it's enjoyed.The nose is slightly sour with nice hints of toffee.Taste is warm with hints of dark chocolate and toffee and a subtle clean bitters finish.Mouthfeel is well rounded.Mar 24, 2013"", ""From a 1 L brown bottle, capped with a flip-top lid.

Flavours of both alcohol and hops linger long after a sip is taken. Malts are heavily toasted, with burnt flavours mixing with the fairly prevalent hop bitterness. Beautiful balance.Mouthfeel (4): Oily and slick with a very thick body. Leaves an extremely dry pallet behind. The dryness really aids in letting the flavours linger long after a sip.Overall (4): A beer that hits the Imperial Stout style perfectly, strong malt sweetness mixes with hits of hops & good alcoholic lingerings... all sitting on the pallet at the finish. Flavours sit so long, that it is difficult to have more than 1 in a single sitting. Great for a cool night.Mar 02, 2013"", ""1L bottle, yes that's right, 1 whole litre of 9% beer.

Robust yet subtle aroma of roasted dark malts, with the smoky barrel tannins I associate with this style. The rich mouthfeel is a pleasure to sip, and the taste is well balanced but sufficiently complex to be interesting. Sweet caramelized chocolate and black malts with a bitterly dry aftertaste that still maintains sugary molasses elements. Hints of peat and aged wood flesh out the combination.

The bitterness lingers with the astringent, burnt malt. Overall this is a really intense imperial stout, especially for it\'s abv.

The taste is big bittersweet chocolate, mildly roasted coffee, creamed caramel, earthy semi-sweet molasses, and prominent earthy, weedy hops, their substantial potential bitterness somehow plowed under. In the morass that is the malt/hop showoff here, the big 9 points of booze get a pass as far as their oral effect is concerned.The bubbles are nicely restrained, the body a solid medium weight, and just a bit prickly from hop and/or booze (who knows at this point) but overall things wind up pretty damned smooth. It finishes a mite bit drier than expected, the hops and bitter side of the chocolate aiding and abetting, but not without a still hefty nod to their existential better half.One of the hoppier examples of an RIS I have thus far encountered, which is no bad thing, as the chocolatey malt counterpoint is more than equal to the task.

Mouthfeel- Medium bodied with light carbonation. There is a pleasant sticky characteristic to this one.Overall- A very enjoyable RIS from Howe Sound.

Rich, heavy roasted malt smell with light hop notes.A little heavy on the malts and a bit light on the hops in taste, but not nearly as bitter or vinous as some imperial stouts I\'ve had. Good hit of coffee and chocolate, with a faint raisin-wine background. Very little hop presence. Nice and thick with out being too ""chewy.""Not sure of the alcohol, but there was only a very light alcohol burn.

When Fat Tug first showed up in these parts two years back, I had been hoping that more Driftwood brews would soon follow... but this is actually the first new one I've seen in Ontario since.Pours a deep, opaque mahogany-black hue with reddish highlights; situated atop is a full inch of khaki-coloured, creamy-looking foam that gradually disintegrates over the next five-plus minutes. A smooth, thin cap and collar remain, but little in the way of lacing is left behind. Smells of rich, roasted dark malts, with coffee grounds, molasses, cocoa and a light smokiness standing out, rounded off by light suggestions of dark fruit and vaguely herbal hops. Robust aroma for this style.A rock solid English-style porter. Or stone solid, whatever - the intense dark roasted malt character that was expressed so effectively on the nose carries through into the flavours. Toasted bread, caramelized sugars and treacle come through amidst pronounced notes of cocoa powder, dark chocolate and espresso. The back end tends towards bittersweet, with hints of coffee and herbal, earthy hop notes helping to counteract the dominance of the malts. Moderately persistent aftertaste, with a hint of smoke and a lingering roasty note. Light-medium in body, with low carbonation that weakly nudges the surface of the palate; feels smooth and a bit watery in the mouth, which is probably it's weakest trait IMO. But it's a forgivable one, because this porter tastes great and drinks like a champ.Final Grade: 4.17, an A-. Driftwood's Blackstone Porter is one of the best Canadian-made porters I've sampled in quite some time, with a highly satisfying flavour profile that does not skimp out on anything. I am really digging those hints of smoke in particular. It's not likely to unseat my current favourite in this category (Fuller's LP), as it's double the price - but there's no doubt that this is still a fine, robust-flavoured porter that I'd happily recommend to other BAs. I will be buying more of this until the stock runs out.Feb 14, 2018"", 'Pitch black with an amber tinge when held to the light. Topped with 3 fingers of deep, beige head.Smells of roasted marshmallows, chocolate, toasted notes, and cocoa.Tastes of coke, chocolate, vanilla, and chocolate milk.Very smooth, rich textured and pleasant. Medium low carbonation.Got this at Summerhill LCBO in Toronto, drinking in Muskoka with my brother February 2nd, 2018. Excellent porter, smooth and well rounded.Feb 02, 2018', ""A- This one pours with a beautiful dark brown color that contains just a tinge of reddish hues right around the rim....different than any other porter I've had! The head is also beautiful, being about two fingers thick to start and settling rather softly into a caramel palate over the brew around a half finger in thickness....it is dense and creamy looking to boot! Carbonation is too hard to see and lacing is on the heavy side of modest....there is some artwork forming on the side of my glass. A nice looking porter!S- Coffee of the black variety, chocolate (dark), lots of sweet and charred malts....I detect the black and chocolate roasts used and the sweetness comes from caramel malt. Woody notes and even a hint of smokiness are noticed on the aroma.....toasted caramel/toffee, blackstrap molasses and creamy mocha round out the finish. Looking forward to tasting this!T- Heavy smooth dark chocolates, cafe au lait, huge toastiness from the black and chocolate malts, dark toffee sweetness, hints of chocolate covered cherry fruit, hazelnut/walnut/burnt almond robustness, creamy yeast and a finish that is dry and Earthy, yet it has a refreshing mild hop bitterness that just helps keep things in check....it is noticed at the back of my throat. The aftertaste lingers on well after the taste, making me crave yet another sip....M/O- Super creamy smooth body, the carbonation is tight and simply suits this style of ale, and the alcohol is very well hidden....this is a real treat. Drinkability is high as I could enjoy at least a few of these in a sitting.....could see this being a superior Porter on tap too! I highly recommend and will seek it out again....another great beer by Driftwood!Dec 31, 2017"", 'This was poured into an English pint glass. The appearance was a dark brown close to black color with no head or lace. The aroma had some rugged dark to bitter chocolate malts with a nice roasty balance. The flavor lends a hand to the roasty side and then the bitterness of the chocolate nibs end up blending nicely. Robust smooth bitter chocolatey aftertaste running into the finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. Moderate carbonation. ABV felt nicely. Overall, really easy going Porter well worthy of having again.Jun 27, 2017', 'Weak head on top of typical porter elements. Smoke and chocolate with coffee and dark fruit. Something in here was definitely missing to tie everything together. But it was passable for sure.Jun 19, 2017', ""Appearance: Super dark brown, nears black but is still in the brown spectrum. Meager half finger of loose bubbly ecru head that quickly drops into a small floating West indies island shape, with a small reef around the ring and pretty much clear of much if any lace, when it does stick, it slowly drops back down the sides.Aromas: Super medium dark chocolate off the top, some sweet malts with caramel and brown sugar. Maybe a hint of nuttiness, but stays fairly well away from the more earthy tones.Taste: Bold but tempered, tastes an awful lot like a room temperature quality coffee with some chocolate milk sweetener. It is robust and flavourful, a little bit of a white sugar sweetness and a slight walnut accoutrement.Mouthfeel: It is a thinner medium, smooth and the cleanliness of the water is there (as it is with most of what I've had from Driftwood - for whatever reason the water itself has a very distinctive, clean and clear feel.) Carbonation is pretty timid, as evident from the short head, but with a swish or two on the palate it does provide a pleasurable thrill to the roof of the mouth and the tongue, which interrupts its overall creaminess slightly but nothing to dramatic. It has a warming finish on the throat, with some bitter linger that gently falls asleep in short order.Overall: a very satisfying and pleasing porter. I'm not sure if I have had one that is so even tempered and passively bold. Delightfully done, almost excelling in its ability to be average and be what a porter should be.Pairing: This was a bit easier for me - only because I had a pretty good idea going in to it what I was going to be eating. I make a pretty killer (meatless) 12 bean chili that you'd swear was full of small chunks of meat. And that was my target, I really wanted to compliment that chocolatelyness, so I didn't spicy it up too much (keeping the chipotle chili powder out) and also used half of the brown sugar I usually use to sweeten it. And it worked out pretty good. Stewed tomatoes, red onion, a whole bunch of beans, plenty of moderated spices, and simmered in the slowcooker for 10 hrs... served with lightly buttered homemade dinner rolls.Oct 31, 2016"", 'Poured from a 650ml bottle.A: Pours a Super dark brownish black with a very thin tan head with some minor lacing.S: A nice smoky coffee, chocolate roasted malts nose ,very nice.T: Toasted malts with coffee and caramels complex for sure.F: Good balance all around not a lot of carbonation.O: Not a big Porter guy but i like this one kind of easy drinking on a fall day.Oct 20, 2016', 'Pours a deep black with about two fingers of head that is brownish in color.

A suitably named offering to enjoy on Black Friday, I put forth.This beer pours a pretty solid black, with minor basal mahogany highlights, and two fingers of puffy, rather loosely foamy, and bubbly brown head, which leaves a decent band of cobwebbed lace around the glass as it evenly subsides.It smells of roasted caramel malt, bittersweet chocolate wafers, wet ash, singed black coffee, a hint of licorice root, and very plain earthy, leafy, and floral hop bitters. The taste is grainy, gritty caramel malt, chalky cocoa powder, muted cafe-au-lait, a weak dark fleshy orchard fruitiness, further random toasty notes, and the same understated earthy and herbal noble hoppiness from the nose.The bubbles are quite tame and innocuous, yet somehow apparently supportive in their veiled frothiness, the body a sturdy medium weight, and more or less smooth, with a seemingly failed attempt at an airy creaminess. It finishes off-dry, but not by much, the toasty malt, dark chocolate, and ethereal milkiness carrying the day.Overall, this is a mostly well-wrought version of the venerable London Porter, but I find myself searching for a reason to really like this, instead of it bonking me over the head with its grandeur. Anyways, drinkable enough, especially with all that snow outside (here, not in Victoria, I imagine), and worthy of the Anglo aura being generated around it.Nov 27, 2015', 'Bottle: Poured a black color porter with a nice dark brown foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of chocolate malt with light dry roasted notes is interesting. Taste is dominated by chocolate malt notes with some dry roasted malt and a dry aftertaste.

Cheers man! From a bomber into a snifterAPPEARANCE: Pours a 1+ finger, medum looking, tan head with good retention. Head fades to a faint wisp and bubbly ring, leaving some clinging lacing on the top of the glass. Black body with lower levels of carbonation. A ring and slight wisp remain until the end leaving some decent lacing down the glass. Good looking porter. SMELL: I see what's going on here. Huge nose on this one. Roasted malts, lots of dark chocolate, coffee aromas, and a nice dose of sweet vanilla cream. Very bold and enticing. Excellent stuff. TASTE: Some dark malts, caramel notes and light roasted touches up front, but this is generally weaker and less impressive than the nose. Dark chocolate at the swallow, then a medium but lingering finish of caramel malts, vanilla sweetness and some bitterness from the chocolate and coffee flavors. This gets a little bigger and more impressive as it sits, and although it is good, it doesn't quite match the nose. PALATE: Medium body and medium levels of carbonation. Creamy enough, goes down fine and finishes dry on the palate. Almost a little astringent, but works out fine. OVERALL: Quality beer for sure, though the nose stole the show and the rest of the cast just couldn't quite keep up.

T - Rich coffee and dark, pungent malts. Very robust in flavour. Well rounded, but bold.M - The carbonation is a little sharp for an English style porter, and so, must be scored as below average for the style. A little calmer carbonation would really improve this already excellent brew. The carbonation does calm down a little bit as it sits in the glass, but, just a tad too assertive overall, in my opinion.D - Very, very good. This brew is complex enough to be a slow sipper, but friendly and enticing enough to be a gulper. Improves considerably as it warms.I might be a bit biased, because I love the English porter style, however, this brew is a solid example of how it should be done.

Silky smooth, medium body, light hops in the back, light lacing.Overall: I was left a little wanting on the taste side of it all - lots of burnt/roasting malts that perhaps was a little too dominant.

For some reason that I cannot really articulate I went into this experience with fairly low expectations ... OK, this will be yet another reasonably tasty and well-crafted but not earth shattering west coast IPA, like something from Tree or another BC brewer a notch or two below Phillips or Central City. I was very happy to be wrong on this occasion. This one looks nice, a peachy orange-red with around three inches of beige bubbles. Nose is chock full of tropical fruit, with melon, guava, passion fruit, and grapefruit rind detectable along with a mellow yet persistent caramel malt backbone. Apparently this brew contains two hop blends (Zythos and Falconer's Flight) and when you do the math there are something like 17 different hops making contributions here, which could account for why this tastes so wicked. There is a real New Zealand influence here, with the tropical fruit and gooseberry flavors very prominent. I even get some floral rosewater and strawberry, lemon tea, and a darker floral note (tobacco?). This sucker is complex. However, instead of remaining fruity and floral, an aggressive pine resin flavor gathers steam like a menthol cough drop and the finish is bitter and aggressive but not coarse. There is a cool evolution from sweet flavors to green pine bitterness, with a tannic tartness throughout. On top of all this, the malts go beyond the typical IPA sweet profile, starting with some butterscotch and moving toward some toasted and near-roasted notes. Body is just shy of moderately chewy and this does coat the mouth a bit. What a super-tasty package all told.

The box is stamped ""05/23/13"", which I have to assume means that this probably isn\'t the freshest IPA I\'ve ever tried. Still, let\'s at least give it a fair chance, eh? Served slightly chilled. Pours a clear golden-amber colour, generating about 1.5 fingers of puffy, pillowy white head. Great retention - it takes the better part of five minutes to recede, caking the sides of the glass in a doily pattern of lacing as it slowly seeps away. Enticing aroma, with a lot of the usual West Coast IPA tropes - grapefruit pith, orange pulp and pine resin can all be detected with ease, in addition to vibes of mango and pineapple. Quite inviting.And not at all misleading, as the first sip confirms that this is a delicious, quality IPA. Caramel sweetness and bready malts contribute much more strongly here than on the nose, but the hops soon come screaming in, offering up a mixture of grapefruit and orange rinds, lemon zest, and some tropical fruit notes. It becomes increasingly earthy into the finish, culminating in a resiny finish combining pine sap and bitter grapefruit. Medium-bodied, with moderate carbonation and fairly high drinkability for the style. Final Grade: 4.14, an A-. Switchback IPA is a well-crafted Canadian IPA, offering enough of a malt backbone to keep things somewhat balanced, while still packing in plenty of West Coast hop punch - more than enough to please the real fans of this style. Probably the best inclusion in this sampler pack by a comfortable margin, although the other 5 brews are certainly worth a look, too. A great IPA that I\'d love to try a fresher sample of - give this one a shot if you spot it locally and are in the mood for something hoppy.Sep 28, 2013', 'Poured into a tulip this had a large rocky white head and left some pretty solid lacing. Colour is a bright medium gold with fair bit of carbonation. Leaves a nice lacing. 4S – a bit hop kick to it. Lots of oily delicious hops, grapefruit, pine sap, mango, lots of florals, clean biscuit malt with a mild marzipan note. Exotic fruits, papaya, cherry, and a herbal spiciness to boot. Lots of hops. 4T – starts fruity, with more of the exotic tropical notes, mango, pine, grapefruit, with some light tree nuts, stone fruits and florals coming in, a clean biscuit malt. Oiliness and a herbal kick, olives, lemon, has a distinct creaminess to it before the finish dries it out and leaves a pleasant balanced bitterness, herbal oils and long aftertaste. Really full profile and the balance is pretty great, bitterness is not extreme and the hops are really tasty. 4.5M – moderate body and carbonation, creamy body with a good degree of oiliness to it, finish is crisp with some dry carbonation and a long aftertaste. Gets the job done nicely. 4The market for pacific IPAs is competitive to say the least. I think this is definitely capable of holding its own, lots of juicy citrus fruitiness, really bright and clean, and a balanced profile with a pleasant dry finish. All works quite well together, this is a winner, and very drinkable. 4.25Sep 11, 2013', 'This is beer #4 out of the BC craft brewery sampler pack available at the LCBO and it is the first truly decent one of the lot -- finally!Clear bright orange gold under a moderate head that settles to a film, lots of spotty lace.Nose is rich with citrus and pine hops, tropical fruit with something oily or resiny lurking in the background.

There is also some grapefruit and a bit of mango. It ends with a mildly bitter buttery hoppy aftertaste.Overall - I am sure this is fantastic fresh.

The taste is a surprising uptick in the bitterness, spread deftly across a somewhat tropical fruitiness - grapefruit, papaya, and mandarin orange - with further dank pine needles propping things up, before slowing ceding minority control to a simple, and softly bready caramel malt. That indistinct drying earthiness hangs out, kicking it a bit as well.The carbonation is a tad frothy at times, but generally low-key in its support, the body just on the lee side of medium weight, and mostly smooth, the hops nicking in here and there. It finishes off-dry, a wee bit surprisingly, as the now musty caramel malt benefits from the (time well) spent-seeming nature of the hops.A rather enjoyable bitter, fruity Yankee IPA, whose grace stems from its ability to convince me from the outset that this is a truly balanced affair. Sessionable? Sure - unless all the other patrons ordering it around me drain the keg first (and at 8 bones a pop at that!).May 13, 2013', 'Bottle from Rutager, 12oz into a tulip.Clear orange with a nice two finger white head.

Very powerful aroma.Taste: Starts a bit tame with some grapefruit, nothing strong then segues into a peach syrup flavor. Strong biscuity malt upfront kind of overshadows the hops. Gets better as it warms as some spiciness and plush orange appear.Mouthfeel: Very balanced but maybe a bit too conservative? The finish is nice and the overall feel is crisp.Overall: Don't drink this one too cold or you might miss some nuances.

T - Sharp bitterness up front with grapefruit, pine and tangerine notes. The tropical fruit from the nose doesn't translate to the palate. A trace of malt sweetness is present in the background. M - Medium body with moderate carbonation.Jun 10, 2012"", ""Thanks to DaftCaskBC for hooking me up with this one a couple weeks ago. Poured into straight pint glass. Poured a lightly hazy golden straw yellow color, with about a half inch of off-white head that had medium light retention and light lacing.The aroma was pine hops upfront, with some grapefruit/citrus notes behind that. There wasn't much grain or malt in the aroma. On the tongue, the pine hops again grabbed your attention first, with the citrus notes following along. There was just enough malt to notice on the taste buds. The beer had a lingering bitter-grapefruit finish.The body was fairly typical for the style, although a bit thinner than i personally prefer. Drinkability was good, if you're a hop head, you could easily drain several of these. Overall, a very nice take on the style. Nothing earth-shattering or groundbreaking, just a pretty good take on a favorite style for a lot of folks. Certainly trying if you see it, and probably worth setting up a trade for.Apr 29, 2012"", ""55ml bottle poured into tulip 12/4/12A golden yellow with a thumbs width of off white head doesn't last all that long but leaves lace where it existed S tropical notes, tangerine, pineapple, guava, mango, gooseberry (avec chat tinkle) the list keeps going, floral with a little pine, smells like a sexy West Coast IPA too me T whats listed above but less tropical flesh, more rind and pine with some earthy hops, still very solid but I preferred the nose M perfect carbonation, bitter for sure but not enamel stripping, flavors linger of citric rind for quite a while, pretty solid hereO a big winner in my books, 4.25 would be useful here for taste and feel so overall scores adjusting accordingly, somewhat balanced and I'm loving the hop profile When this one popped up on the Canadian top 100 my interest was sparked for sure, when it showed up in a box from the most generous Rutager I now understand why. This one would be in my fridge on a constant basis if I could buy it in this part of the world.Apr 12, 2012"", 'A: Pours with barely a finger of white head that dissipates to a thin ring round the glass. Interesting pumpkin orange, clear and very low on bubbly carbonation. S: Piney wet wood, with grapefruit rind and hints of pineapple. T: Taste pops with hoppy bitterness. Similar to the smell, the taste starts strong with woodsy pine resins and white grapefruit rind. There\'s a funkiness of wet earth, if you know the Pacific North West you may get a taste reminiscent of a wet PNW morning. M: For the lack of carbonation in the glass there seems to be a prick of carbonation in the mouth. Medium bodied nice to drink - not to thick not to thin. O: Unlike Red Race IPA, there is no floral scent. Switchback rides heavy on the woodsy taste and smell. If Switchback and Red Racer IPA were perfumes, Switchback would be ""for Him"" and Red Racer would be ""for Her"". Excellent hoppy citrus/woody taste, I may actually have to change my preferred beer from dark Belgian ale to IPA.Apr 01, 2012', 'Appearance.

Not picking much up smell wise besides citrusy grapefruit. Told this has a bunch of NZ hops. Whatever it is its quite delish. A well balanced beer. I get more of a dank tangerine profile going on.

Goes well with food too.Mar 31, 2012', '2oz bottle (355 mL) served in pint glass. Beer pours a clear pale amber with a thin white head. Fresh, cascadey aroma.Beer is dead on with a load of alpha acid and citrusy goodness. As the ABV would indicate, this is a pretty big beer -- a healthy balance in between a west coast IPA and a double/imperial IPA. Mouthfeel is relatively thin in terms of weight, which works well with the moderate carbonation and hop-forward style. Overall I am very pleased.Mar 27, 2012', 'A: 3/4"" cream coloured head that left a nice lacing over amber coloured liquid with excellent clarity. Can\'t ask for much more out of an IPA.S: Pine, earth, grass, grapefruit; smells like we have a hop bomb on our hands. It smells similar to Pliny the Elder.T: Pine, grapefruit, grass and earth up front that gives way to a tasty and sweet malt base. Extremely tasty.M: Medium viscosity and medium level of somewhat foamy carbonation. O: Beautiful. Red Racer IPA and Driftwood Fat Tug move over; there is a new kid in town and he\'s not pulling any punches. I have no problem saying that this is easily one of Canada\'s best IPAs. It has the smell profile of Pliny the Elder and the taste profile similar to Stone IPA but more grassy and earthy, and with a better tasting and sweeter malt backbone to finish it up.Mar 24, 2012', ""Poured into 4oz taster @ The Island Beer FestFWIW, this beer was HEAVILY advertised...like, by far and away more than any other beer @ Club 919!A: Light and transluscent gold, almost pilsner-like, with that big head characteristic of Coast IPAs. Dissipated fast, with clean white lacing.S: Not very strong, but certainly citrusy: pineapple and grapefruit, with some light hop. This was tasted late in the festival, though, so my olfactory sense was slightly compromised.T: Light and surprisingly refreshing, much like a hoppy grapefruit juice. Some pineapple, lots of hop on the finish.M: Creamy but light, this beer has it all. Long-lingering on the tongue, with moderate carb.O: A nice beer, certainly more chuggable than Fat Tug (as I've seen it compared) but not as much as Hop Circle.

This is not to say it's an unbalanced beer or an overdone hopbomb - quite bearable.M - Tangy bite, but very refreshing.

I don't usually comment on the packaging, but they've done a REALLY great job here. Great art work on an open six-pack, non-twist-off, 355mL bottle like a newer American stubby (like Sierra Nevada). As much as I love it, I'd love to see this in cans!S: Very perfumy. Definitely some Simcoe and Amarillo here, with a few other new school hops for plenty of depth: Tangerine, pine, lemon grass, gooseberry, nectarine, a bit dank. T: Piny resin, tangerine, lemon grass, nectarine, mango, gooseberry (but not really catty), bit of sponge toffee from the malt, solid bitterness.M: Well-attenuated, moderate body has a light hop acidity.D/O: Really an all-around great brew. This is in the same league as the Red Racer and Fat Tug IPA... and the bitterness and hopping (aroma & flavour) do seem to fall between the two. Actually, the plethora of hops is probably on-par with Red Racer, but the bitterness is a bit less assertive than the mighty Fat Tug.I'll be buying this one. Lately I've preferred the assertive bitterness of the Fat Tug over the Red Racer Hop fix (bong water?)... but I don't always feel like opening a whole bomber. I can see myself drinking this new-school IPA, as well as the more sessionable, old-school Hophead from Tree.Their small brewer, big flavour series has certainly showed they have talent. I'm glad this is now routinely available.Mar 18, 2012"", 'Damn , Lighthouse is shooting for the stars with this new IPA. Big , hoppy and a citrus nose to die for. I remember how their first IPA was very conservative and styled after the British versions but this IPA is pure PNW and ranks alongside Phillips,Tree and Driftwood as one of the best In BC.Mar 16, 2012', ""Appearance: A perfectly clear gold, could fool anyone into believing its a lager. A nice soapy head on top and some good lacing.Smell: Huge tropical and fruity hop notes! This beers aroma explodes in the nose, so much flavor. I can get mango, passionfruit, a little pineapple, and maybe some peach, very diverse. One of the best smelling IPAs I have ever come across.Taste: Very bitter, right off the bat. After that there is a strong citrus presence that comes into play, and then the tropical fruitiness. This is a very tasty beer, very one sided, I can hardly get a trace of malt character, but still very tasty.Mouthfeel: The carbonation is very crisp and clean, but the body lacks character and the beer feels a little thin if I am being picky.Overall: A must try if you are into the Tropical hop profile, and highly recommended to even those who aren't.

It requires the better part of ten minutes to fully seep away, eventually leaving behind a lumpy, foamy cap and a generous collar, in addition to multiple rings of sticky lace. This beer is gorgeous, but the aroma is somewhat less, well, attention-grabbing - I am getting a lot of citrusy orange, candied grapefruit, pine resin and some tropical fruitiness. This is alongside molasses and caramelized sugar sweetness, overlying a muted roasted malt backbone - hints of chocolate and coffee come through, but in a very subdued manner.Things get kicked up a notch once this stuff hits my tongue - the tastebuds are immediately bombarded with big blasts of roasted malt and molasses sweetness. Cocoa powder, dark-roasted coffee and rich dark chocolate are quite dominant, with the (somewhat less-robust, but no less appealing) hop flavours featured next. Pineapple, pithy grapefruit citrus and pine resin provide a last-minute surge, with the profile finishing upon a lingering, earthy hop astringency that really clings to the palate. Medium-full in body, with light carbonation levels and a seriously smooth, creamy feel that makes for a fulfilling, hearty presence on the palate. This is the sort of beer that would clearly excel during the winter months, but there's certainly no reason I can't enjoy it in May, either - it's holding up very nicely, and this batch should remain yummy well into the summer.Final Grade: 4.24, a high A-. Phillips' Cabin Fever is a very well-made black ale that I am really digging right now. In a bit of a twist for this style - the malt bill really takes command here, but that's not to say that the hops don't provide a sizeable punch on the back end. There's plenty of citrusy, resiny bitterness to satisfy the hop fanatics. Quality black IPAs are not particularly commonplace at the LCBO, so this is a highly-welcome addition that I hope to see back next year. Definitely worth a pick-up if you spot it locally, and I will likely be purchasing another bottle, as the price point is pretty good too.May 11, 2015"", 'Bottle: Poured a clear black color ale with a large dark brown foamy head with OK retention and some lacing. Aroma of dry roasted malt with some light astringent notes. Taste is dominated by dry roasted malt notes with some astringent notes and some citrus hoppy notes with subtle tart notes in the aftertaste. Body is slightly below average with good carbonation. I thought this one balance and was too astringent for my own taste.Apr 10, 2015', ""650 ml bottle served cold into a pint glass. Purchased from LCBO for $6.30 CDN. Excited to try yet another black ale, this seems to be a style I just can't get enough of.Appearance - virtually the darkest shade of brown I've ever seen, as close to black as you can be without being black. Opaque with an ominous three finger tan head and an incredible amount of frothy lacing left behind. Great retention that lasts a while and leaves behind a thin layerof foam on top.Smell - big nose that starts with a juicy fruit aroma of pineapple and orange then a wallop of roasted malt with a slight burnt edge comes into play. A touch of coffee an chocolate for good measure. Great nosethwt transitions back to fruit before the end and a bit of a burnt sugar aroma.Taste - like the nose this starts juicy with pineapple and other citrus blends then goes roasty with some coffee and leather.

Finishes bitter.Mouthfeel - smooth with good carbonation, fairly creamy but not syrupy and a hefty body that retains refreshment. Good feel for the style.Overall - awesome beer, with lots of flavours, juicy fruit flavours and dry roasty grain and malts mixed into with an aroma that backs it up.

Roasted chickenEnjoyMar 23, 2015', ""Cabin Fever hasn't plunged entirely into darkness; chestnut highlights survive along the base and, at the right angle, even provide by a menial amount of transparency. Enough foam formed from the pour I'm tempted scoop it out and make a milkshake out of it - heck, it already looks like one! The nose isn't very expressive, especially for a style that on the whole tends to really be. Gooey, roasted malts or piny, citrusy hops - either is acceptable and yet neither seems to want the spotlight (usually they fight tooth and nail for that ever important first impression). This bouquet is blank. The taste, on the other hand, is far from it. Whatever absence of flavour on the nose it's doubly made up for on the palate. A serious question for Phillips: do you add a shot of espresso to each bottle? What about dark caramel fudge? This has a most chocolaty, dessert worthy taste full of coffee- and caramel-accented roasted maltiness. Hops factor more in the mouthfeel. The finish is dry and has leafy, woody, and resinous notes that stick to it like burrs. A little splash of lemony acidity also cleanses any borderline-burnt flavours that might otherwise linger and leaves the palate refreshed and ready for another sip. I wouldn't rank Cabin Fever as a first tier Black IPA except insofar as its drinkability - it is a wonderfully agreeable example of the style, especially when you consider its strength (8.5%, something I didn't mention until now because, frankly, I never noticed). More enjoyable than impressive, I think Phillips is capable of more but I'm nonetheless a happy camper with the few bottles I bought.Mar 19, 2015"", 'Another win for Phillips! This beer has everything I love about the style. Beautiful, root beer-like appearance, grapefruit and cocoa nose, roasted malts and a robust hop finish.

Lots of grapefruit and tangerine hops on the nose, almost perfectly balanced by some wood char, cacao, and coffee notes. Quite floral as well. Splendid aroma and this is one to keep sniffing as you drink. Palate is nearly as good, with a sweet beginning that immediately goes charred and then back to sweet again. Burnt concord grape and citrus lead the way, followed by rather dry char and coffee that holds my attention for a while, although a rock candy like sweetness eventually sets in and persists for the rest of the journey. Some black and green peppercorn spice notes also put in an appearance and the floral hops from the nose also hang tight for the duration. Not super thick of body despite the ""imperial"" designation and moderately carbonated. Finish is dry and roasted but with an unusually prominent watermelon Jolly Rancher flavor that I could still detect an hour post-consumption. This could be a top ""American Black Ale"" for me, an excellent balance of dark burnt malts and citrus/floral hops that Phillips might do well to elevate to regular status.Jun 24, 2014', 'A - coal black with just a little light getting through the bottom, tower of creamy tan head, held its own with plenty of consistent lacingS - leafy and piney hops hit you, quickly followed by some nutty maltT - more of a earthy hop dominance up front with accents of leafy greens, solid compliment of nutty malt with a touch of licorice, very nicely balancedM - medium body with a creamy start, fairly full with a medium bitterness through the finishO - its a big beer with a balance that makes it drink like a small beer, full of hop and malt flavours from start to finish, outstanding example of the styleMay 31, 2013', ""From a 650 ml brown bottle.

M: medium-fullbodied but with a line of bitterness that cuts through.O: declaration-- American/Cascadian Black Ale is a beer style that I really don\'t care for (this bottle was a gift).

Bedlam in the brain stem, eh, Phillips?This beer pours a very dark, polished mahogany brown hue, with basal cola highlights, and three fingers of puffy, shiny, and rocky beige head, which leaves some broad, fuzzy swaths of patchy lace around the glass as it lazily sinks away.It smells of sweet citrus, pine and perfumed floral hop esters right off the bat, followed up by oily bar nuts, biscuity chocolate malt, a slight yeastiness, dry bready caramel, and a further pithy and musty vegetal character. The taste is gritty, toasted dark bready malt, singed cocoa powder, bitter citrus cream and spruce tips, and some further floral, earthy hops. Simple, but really quite effective, and no sign of the elevated ABV.The carbonation is present, a tad frothy, and generally agreeable, the body a solid medium weight, a wee bit airy, and mostly smooth. It finishes off-dry, the roasted chocolate malt and prickly citrus/pine hops still running the table.I'm usually nonplussed by most ABAs, mostly on account of their lack of long-haul drinkability, for whatever reason. Not so here - Phillips has rendered a smooth, blackened and semi-sweet, but still hoppy ale, all deftly balanced for our drinking pleasure, and with an extra boost of booze that you don't even see coming.

Moderate carbonation.Mar 15, 2013"", 'I grabbed a bottle at the tasting tonight and had to crack it open. Cabin Fever pours an inky black that shows just a bit of brown light shining though when held up to the light. The aroma is citrusy and piney hops with dry chocolate and maybe a hint of caramel. The flavor is resinous and bitter with a big one two punch of slightly astringent dark malt and piney, earthy hops. The bitterness is intensified by the slight astringency and a distinct chocolate malt flavor lingers along with the tongue coating bitterness. The beer manages to maintain a pretty decent body despite the dryness.

From a bomber into a snifterAPPEARANCE: A black pour yields a two finger, medium looking, mocha colored head with decent retention. Head quickly fades to a faint wisp and ring. Jet black body with almost zero carbonation evident. A ring remains until the end and leaves some nice lacing down the glass. Good looking beer. SMELL: Roasted malts, dark chocolate and whisky notes. Vanilla, sweet cream and iced cappuccino in there as well. The whisky is bold enough and works well with the light coffee, cappuccino and chocolate aromas. Really nice stuff. TASTE: Roasted notes, with some wisky and vanilla flavors up front, then dark chocolate and coffee at the swallow. Milder but lingering finish of iced cappuccino, coffee, dark chocolate, and then some whisky, vanilla and sweet cream from the barrels. The barrels are mild, but the sweetness works and makes it taste like a desert beer. Easy to drink as well. PALATE: Medium, lighter body with a touch higher amounts of carbonation. A little light on the palate, but creamy enough, goes down smooth and finishes a touch dry. Could be a little heavier and mouth-coating for the style, but passable. OVERALL: A really nice beer for sure. The nose was fantastic on this one, but the flavors would need to be a little bolder for top marks there. Moreover, the palate needs to be a touch bigger to help carry the flavor a bit more. In any case, this is a good beer that's well worth the effort. Thanks again Rutager.

One of the darker beers I've ever seen, for sure.S - Big, dark and roasty. Roasted malt upfront, with some smoked malt, resinous earth, and oak. Not as much coffee as I had anticipated, but more-so sweet with cocoa and dark chocolate. Rounds out with hints of anise, vanilla and molasses. As it warms a bit more I start getting some fruity notes, with raisins being the most prominent.T - Opens up big and dark, with roasted barley and lots of dark malty goodness. Cocoa powder and dark chocolates fill the mid-palate, giving it a short lived sweetness, before it opens up to a long-lasting finish of smoke, roasted malt, oak, anise, vanilla and a touch of molasses. Roasty bitterness and subtle coffee grounds lingers long after, along with a touch of alcohol warmth. While this beer boasts an undeniably big flavor profile, and offers a variety of flavors and respectable complexity, it feels a bit underwhelming overall.M - Thick and full, with low carbonation and big body, keeping it nice and smooth. This one also wastes no time getting sticky on the lips, but doesn't feel syrupy or oily at any point. I expected a bit more bite at the back of the palate on this one, but it feels smoother this way.D - I don't have a witty metaphor like biboergosum to justify why I'm drinking the BA version of this brew before the stock one, but my reasoning is the same; I've simply never seen it. So it should go without saying that with no prior experience with BA stouts, and not having tried the original Hammer for reference, I have little context when it comes to these ratings. That being said, I still found this one to be a bit underwhelming. It definitely lacked a certain bite I was anticipating.

A number of their beers are so close to being great beers, that unfortunately this aspect keeps them back.

I haven't tried the original Hammer yet, so I'm at a bit of a deficit here when it comes to how this barrel-aging has affected or potentially enhanced it.

Pours out an oily opaque black colour, with a couple finger's worth of creamy mocha head that retains to a thick cap.Coffee, cocoa and roasty malt on the nose, a little bit of boozy sweetness, faint wood and herbal hops.Light semi-sweet cocoa and mild roasty malt up front in the flavour, a character of cafe au lait develops in the middle, while things tend to lazily disappear into the finish, although some sweet vanilla-tinged whiskey is revealed into the aftertaste, and the vanilla coats the lips. Flavour comes across very light and mild for the style.Mouthfeel is light for the style, rather thin with a silky smooth/slick texture, yet with moderate carbonation.An easy drinker, that's for sure. Although I'm enjoying the vanilla notes from the bourbon barrel still coating my lips after the glass has been emptied, the impression of the actual ale itself gets more and more faint. Seriously mild for the style, which may help make it an okay entry level beer for those wishing to take baby steps, however doesn't quite live up to spec as advertised. Hate to say it, but this hammer doesn't have much force behind it.Feb 12, 2012"", ""0ml bottle, more weird Soviet-era workers' imagery on the label, with the beer name's font conflating the diacritics and alphabet of at least two different Eastern Bloc languages.

The taste, up front, is more slanted to the dark chocolate than the caramel, but together, they add up to one big malty Ivan Drago punch to the palate; this is all quickly flattened out by a dry, toasty wood edge, aided and abetted by a strangely vodka-like booze warming, with some anise notes flitting about here and there.The bubbles are quite reserved, but not entirely AWOL, and lend a hand in rendering a medium-full, silky smooth body. It all finishes nicely balanced, some sweet choco-caramel malt going the full count against the barrel's wood astringency and simmering booze heat.Having the wood-treated version before the stock version of such a big beer is a bit like seeing the movie version before reading the book, but, hey, my bookstore doesn't carry the 'regular' Hammer.

I made these reviews as a challenge by an acquaintance who said that Alpha Dog was a way better beer than Driftwood’s Sartori Harvest. As I have not had the privilege to try either until now, I figured a good head to head taste off was in order (pun intended). See here (https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/18858/53309/?ba=JonCorbett#review) for my review of Driftwood’s Sartori Harvest. Appearance: Semi hazy darker amber, and takes quite an aggressive pour to get the head going. One finger of fairly loose creamy looking white head. dissipation is quite slow with some light lacing and a smattering of blocky surface flows. (4.25)Aromatics: Fairly bright and sweet smelling. Pineapple and tropical citrus with some green grass and fresh honey. There is slight earthy pine aroma in some of wafting but nothing that undoes the fruitiness in the aroma. (4)Taste: Pretty hop forward with a sweetening at the back end. An almost woody floral touch to the hop bitterness. The sweetening is slightly toffee-like and really doesn’t out-do the bitter, but the malt definitely keeps the bitterness in check. (4)Feel: A nice crisp and clean sip with ample carbonation that is quite active but gentle as well. There is a freshness in the water quality that makes this brew very satisfying. The finish is remarkably clean and dry, there is the slightest of earthy linger but no where near as pronounced as other fresh hopped beers including Satori. Medium bodied and it carries well across the palate. (4.25)Overall: (This is a comparison remember) In my opinion Satori edged out Alpha Dog in appearance, and flavour, but I give Aroma and Feel to Alpha Dog - Overall I think they are fairly equivalent. Alpha Dog though is a bit more consistent in it’s delivery despite the differences in qualities both come in with a decent 4.25 overall. (But in the end with the rating system, Satori did take ""the win"" by a margin of .03) Two great fresh hop brews for sure!Pairing : Unlike Satori which had a sweeter base with heavy sitter linger - Alpha Dog has a relatively clean finish and it’s bitter is not nearly as pronounced which makes it easier to pair with more savoury options. I always like snack based foods with fresh hops brews - and here I think it almost needs a bit of elegance. I love gougères (french cheese puffs) and they would be excellent here. Alpha Dog I think in the end has a more sophisticated palate offering lending it well to a more gracious dinner setting where Satori can definitely be a bit more geared toward a pub-style social atmosphere.Oct 15, 2016', ""Pours a nice head, some retention, lots if lace.2016 is only 5.2%.Great hop aroma, pine, tangerine, nectarine and weed.Awesome flavour, very weedy, but not overly dank.

It smells of bready and doughy caramel malt, muddled domestic citrus rind, orange juice, a mild hard water flintiness, and some understated leafy, weedy, and gently perfumed floral green hop bitters. The taste is rather bitter orange and white grapefruit peel, gritty and grainy caramel malt, plain Pez candies, further indistinct tropical fruit notes, and more weak earthy, leafy, and musty floral verdant hoppiness. The carbonation is fairly innocuous in its workaday frothiness, the body a decent middleweight, and generally smooth, with none of the big fruitiness taking up a contrarian position here. It finishes off-dry, the juiciness of it all hard to deny.Overall, this is a pleasant and engaging version of this stupidly controversial new IPA sub-style - nice and fruity, just malty enough, and not particularly bitter, in the end, that is.

I can't remember the last time I had a barleywine. Sheesh.The body is a deep and toasty reddish brown hue. It has clarity but it's still hard to see through because of how deep its colour is.

Golden raisins and fresh strawberry jam have almost an equal presence. Toffee and brown sugar are at its edges. I'm in love its sticky strawberry jam character. Its ABV only asserts itself by amplifying everything that's going on. What a treat. The taste is a bit surprising with boozy dry chocolate and rye bread making the first impression. Gooey figs and raisins are an undercurrent. Burnt sugar, almost like marshmallow, meshes with its dryness. The alcohol stays alive at the back of the palate long past the finish. Once the taste is gone, its warmth in your chest kicks in. For the most part, it's soft and unobtrusive with a subtle bite in the end. Heavy and slick. It's carbonation level is perfect.

Howe Sound delivers a harmoniously flavourful barleywine that does not disappoint.Apr 26, 2014"", ""375ml bottle, with some particularly difficult to read script below the label title, which describes what the hell a 'Woolly Bugger' is, at least in fishing terms.This beer pours a somewhat murky, dark red-brick amber hue, with a teeming tower of puffy, loosely foamy, and generally bubbly beige head, which leaves some decent cobwebbed lace around the glass as it slowly sinks away.It smells of bready, and kind of biscuity caramel malt, a hard water minerality, muddled black fruit, a touch of crystalline brown sugar, and earthy, leafy, and perfumed hops. The taste is more bready caramel malt, this time with a touch of savoury, leafy spice that points me towards gingerbread or zucchini loaf, peppy dark fruit - in the vein of musty figs and dried cherries - edgy grassy and earthy hops, with a growing alcohol insurgency.The carbonation is pretty low-key, just a heady frothiness throughout, the body medium-full in weight, and mostly smooth, just a mild alcohol tightness slowly evolving as things get on. It finishes on the sweet side, but in a tempered manner, the lingering caramel/toffee malt notes still facing enough musty, earthy hops, weak black fruit, and bristling alcohol to keep things just this side of sane.Truly bang-on for the style, no truck or apology given for being veritably British, rather than the admittedly more sexy Yankee version - so, whatevs. Speaking of all things anglophile, I likes me my ESBs, and this seems very much like the imperialized, boozed up, doubled, however you choose to term it, example of such an imaginary beast. Glad I finally got to try it, without having to sacrifice suitcase/bar stool space on my imminent BC beer pilgrimage.Apr 09, 2014"", ""Appearance: dark red/brown, almost opaque, like dark mahogany; full, dense, almond coloured headAroma: loads of dark dried fruit, mostly prunes, some raisin, cherry; touches of caramel, chocolateTaste & Mouthfeel: getting those dried fruit flavours, but it's cut by alcohol and fairly intense hops that rapidly take over and make for a clean, dry finish (almost palate cleansing); prune flavour has the most breakthrough, but it's almost more about the hops, surprising and interesting; over time it balances out nicely, the bitter notes necessary to cut the syrupy sweetness and in the end providing a pleasing contrast of start vs. finishOverall: great stuff, could have been overwhelming quickly, but well crafted to manage the strong flavours - which are really quite simpleMar 30, 2014"", ""Woolly Bugger - named after an artificial fly fishing lure - isn't the most appealing sounding name for a beer. Indeed, the ale itself is not only racked with sediment but is both lusterless (no shine or highlights) as well as listless (no bubbles or head). This thing won't catch you anything.I know from already having drunk half of it that Woolly Bugger is a rich, malty, and nuanced beer - but I still don't get any of that from the aroma, even having allowed it to warm to room temperature. There's either not much of a bouquet or else my nose is stuffed up (which it isn't, I feel fine). The only things I sense are small quantities of toffee and dried fruits. Most people I know prefer American renditions of the Barleywine style. Though brewed in the English tradition, Woolly Bugger is still likely to please most modern, North American palates given how much resiny, herbal flavour (plus 75 IBUs) they've managed to steep from the (somewhat unsexy) hop bill of Nugget, Fuggles, and Goldings. This has enough leafiness and 'raw green pellet' taste to conjure to mind images of rabbit food. Of course, it also has - in even greater abundance - the maltiness to instill thoughts of nut brittle, rum cake, fruit cake, sticky toffee pudding, and all manner of English confections. All that caramelly grain combines with the esters and 10.5% alcohol to include a cinnamon-driven stewed apple/mulled cider and orange liqueur taste in the backdrop, something easily overlooked by all the sweet treats upfront. There's only moderate depth but absolute quaffability. Just as Pumpkineater is a great fall-time treat and King Heffy is an ultimate summer quencher, Woolly Bugger is rich, malty, and satiating enough to remedy all the cold and darkness of a harsh winter (still its spiced rum cake notes and toffee-laced maltiness make it sumptuous enough to want to just chug back). While a candidate for no more than short-term cellaring, this is nonetheless something you want on-hand in case the snow starts falling or the power goes out.Mar 12, 2014"", 'Bottle: Poured a deep cloudy copper color ale with a rather large foamy head with good retention and some good lacing. Aroma of dry caramelized sugars with light grainy cereal notes. Taste is dominated by load of dry caramelized residual sugars notes with some grainy cereal notes. Body is quite full with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Interesting take on the English-style barleywine but sadly feels a bit short on the complexity front.Feb 08, 2014', '2013 vintage.Beer is dark maroon in colour, with a large beige head. Good retention and lacing.Nose is malty, with sweet bready scents. Caramel and some toffee. Also some grassy hop scents, but the malt is much stronger.Taste is good. Again, a focus on malts. Caramel, toffee. Chewy and bready. Fairly sweet, but there is a toasted flavour that balances it, coupled with a grassy hop bitterness.Full bodied, moderately carbonated. A bit astringent. Overall, pretty good.Jan 24, 2014', ""5 mL bottle from the LCBO. First beer from Howe Sound that wasn't a massive bottle. -25 outside, so a barleywine is just the ticket. Poured into a tulip. Chocolate caramel, with a good sized head of off-white head that survives as a pretty impressive layer with loads of lacing. Great looking brew. Nose is malt-forward, with notes of candied peach and cherry, brown sugar, toffee and red wine. Faint citrus hops.Tasty barleywine indeed, with loads of malt, candied fruit and caramel sweetness, and a hoppy red-wine finish. Lighter bodied than I'd expected. Tannin-like puckery quality, and mild carbonation. Solid barleywine where the hops get some play towards the finish.Jan 02, 2014"", '2013 Release.In a broad tulip glass this throws a nice rich creamy tan head. Colour is a maple syrup brown that in the glass takes on a thick dark mahogany, quite a strong clarity, with nice lacing.S – robust caramel-like malts, butterscotch, a bit of a herbal foresty quality. Minty, and leafy, ontop of brown sugar and rich fruit cake. Intense and rich, a bit boozy.T – rich syrupy brandy cake, maraschino cherries, maple syrup, cigar smoke, super rich thick profile, more bright woodiness on the finish, some spice, and then dry buttery finish. Good transition with a strong malt base, some strong caramels, a bit of a flat bitterness. A fairly typical profile of rich caramel malt and slight booze, warming as hell afterward. Good forward pushing flavor profile that keeps the balance mostly in check. Pleasing sipper with some caramelized dry fruits and berries.M – syrupy, very rich and full mouthful, mouth coating sweet malty caramel character, bit of a spice prickle, some gentle carbonation at the back, give it a bit of balance out but a big robust forward beer. With a long drying aftertaste.A tasty and interesting Barleywine, very rich, a big caramel profile but some interesting complexity backing this up. I think the heat off this is a bit high but the bitterness is very appropriate and overall it is quite a flavourful example that would be worth checking out, may grab another to age. Fresh it had a rich caramelly tobacco, brandy fruitcake richness, with some earthy spicy bitterness, some apparent alcohol but a fair bit of complexity and rich fruitiness character also. Could be improved though, would like the caramel flavour to be so dominant and bit more of a supporting range of flavours.Jan 01, 2014', ""2013 Vintage. 375 ml bottle purchased from LCBO for $5.55CDN. Advertised as 10.5% ABV. Served chilled into a pint glass.Appearance - Murky light cola brown color. Dense 2 finger head is poured with great retention. A few bubbles to the surface. Dense and heavy looking. Head is off white with yellowish hues. Smell - Maple syrup and caramel with some floral hop presence. Maple syrup aroma gets stronger as beer warms. Very smooth and soothing aroma especially in the dead of winter. Also some light grain (barley ) smell.Taste - Starts with maple syrup and caramel sweetness transitioning to a dry hop near rye like flavor. Some roasted grains in the full flavor. Slight booziness and heat on the back end.Mouthfeel - Smooth and refreshing, and slightly syrupy in the way the the mouth is coated, but since it doesn't linger its doesn't have any unpleasant sticky component to it. Medium carbonation too.Overall - Given that this is my first foray into barleywines it was an excellent and enjoyable beer with good balance, rich flavors, a nice variance in aromas and perfect for a Canadian winter. Given how much I enjoyed this one, i'm looking forward to other Howe Sound products to see if they make it to Ontario,Jan 01, 2014"", 'Drinking this 2013 bottle fresh, thanks to its LCBO release. Definitely a ""sipping beer"", as befitting its &gt;10% ABV. Pours an oily chocolate coloured amber with limited head and no lacing. Low carbonation level on this beer despite the decent sounding seal when the bottle was uncapped. Malt forward aroma includes brandied plums with toffee and barrel notes. Not as much complexity as I\'d expected from this brewery given the depth of Pothole Filler, so perhaps expectations were too high? Flavour has a nice bitterness in the finish that complements the alcohol heat. Barrel tannins and brandied fruits round out the body after the initial caramelized malt sweetness passes.Very glad to have tried it, but also glad to have only purchased this one bottle.Dec 29, 2013', ""Been a want of mine for a long time. 2013 Release. A - Deep mahogany colour, deep reddy brown. Good carbonation coming up. One finger of thick beige head. Good lace rings and a half finger of retention. S - Toffee, caramel, dark fruit, a little bit of sugar.T - Caramel, dark fruit, sugar, sharp hop bite, some alcohol. Warms up with more dark fruit and caramel. M - Good carbonation, full body, sharp finish.O/D - This seems more like an American interpretation of the style. The hop/alcohol bite is a bit much for the style. Less dark fruit/caramel character is detected than would be expected. The harshness does mellow out after a while. It's a quality barleywine. With some age it will improve hopefully. Enjoyed it and drank it faster than something 10% should be.Dec 17, 2013"", ""0ml Bottle from the Ottawa LCBO for $5.55 - 2013 editionAppearance - Brown colour with a decent size frothy beige coloured head. There is a low amount of carbonation showing and there is some nice lacing on the sides of the glass. The head lasted for close to 3-4 minutes before it began to dissipate.Smell - Malts, caramel, dark fruits, chocolateTaste & Mouth - There is an average amount of carbonation and I can taste caramel and malts mixed with quite a bit of hops. There is also some dark fruits, chocolate, and some roasted/burnt notes.Overall - I don't drink my barleywines fresh very often so this one has a lot more bitterness than I was expecting. Still very tasty and satisfying. Maybe just a touch too sweet - if I could change 1 thing. Seems like a great beer to tuck away in the cellar. I will pick up a few more bottles.Dec 16, 2013"", 'Deep ruby red-brown colour, one finger of tan head, some lace. Smell is of rich caramel, toffee, lots of malty bread like notes, raisin, fruity with lots of red apple, fairly big flowery hops, finishes with berry. Taste is rich and malty, lots of toffee and caramel flavour, fruity, getting the apple from the nose, moderate bitterness, lightly sweet and only a trace of any alcohol, fruity hop aftertaste, understated citrus. Lightly carbonated, medium-full body. No complaints here, a satisfying barleywine that I will grab a couple more of to enjoy down the road.Dec 16, 2013', ""13 bottle. This batch is pretty different from last year's I think. A: Dark, dark crimson brown. Almost black. Huge head, light brown and nice and thick. S: Far and away my favourite thing about this beer. Sweetness of caramel and vanilla, sweet red fruits like plum, raisin, cherry, and some orange-zest like citrus notes. Also an earthy side to it as well. T: Heavy duty malts up front but not a lot to report taste-wise at first, then eases into plum, fig, and powerful hops. Hops are earthy and moderately bitter. Alcohol heat is quite prominent, as this is a pretty fresh bottle. Not harsh though, just leaves you warmed. M: Thick and grainyO: I think this year's batch is a step up from last year and I look forward to seeing how it develops. Not mind blowing for me but quite tasty and amazing nose!Dec 02, 2013"", ""****December 2012 Vintage***Thanks to FondueVoodoo for this one.Poured from a 341ml. bottle.Appearance: The body when held to the light looks blood red, ecru colored healthy head that recedes to leave a mound surrounded by a moat of sorts. Lacing slathered on the glass.Smell: Rich and malty, earthy, alcoholic caramel if that means something to you.Taste: Nothing at first which isn't normal but brown sugar, and caramel come finally. No complexity or depth, light flavor.Mouthfeel: To its credit, alcohol is very well hidden. Very smooth.Overall: Given the ABV and the style, i expected more depth which unfortunately i didn't get. Decent but there are much better representations of the style.Sep 16, 2013"", ""I have always been impressed with Howe Sound. Simply put: they are easily one of my favorite breweries in Canada due to their experimental nature and quality brews. Appearance - Impressive. Super shiny, creamy head. Almost a lemon meringue appearance. Glossy and sticky. Great head retention for a barley wine. Nice orange ruby brown color. Overall, quite nice.Smell - Lots of northern hops on the nose. This is a slight turn off. Not bad, just spells a bit too much like an IPA versus a barley wine. A nice spicy toffee aroma, very typical of an English barley wine. Butterscotch, slight nuttiness, tropical fruit and brown sugar. Very rich. Alcohol cuts nicely. Taste - Toffee, roasted marshmallow, caramel, butter, mango, almonds, wood (most likely from the barrel aging), bitter chocolate and northern hops (it lists nugget and I feel it may have been used a bit excessively). Slightly citrusy. More citrus than most barley wines (more along the lines of an IPA as far as hops go). Tangy. Lots of special B malt is noticeable. Chocolate malt, too. Very sweet and jammy, like red wine. Alcohol is nicely hidden given it's at 11% abv. Does not offend.Mouthfeel - Full and thick. This is not the heaviest barley wine I've had, but it's still rather chewy and thick. You can feel this all over the mouth. Dark and rich. Syrupy and smooth. Nice carbonation and may be one of the standout features. Overall - A nicely balanced, traditional Barley Wine done well. This may not be the best I've had in this style, but it is tasty and delicious, nonetheless. Personally, I would like to see one of two things:1) Less boil time of hops, or less nugget hops added as a whole, or 2) A different variety of hops (maybe German or English hops instead of nugget)I look forward to aging my other bottle and seeing how this develops over time. I most likely will wait at least another 6 years to try this again. Very solid attempt.Jun 17, 2013"", 'Date: 03/15/2013Type: 11.2oz. BottleVintage: 2012Glass: East End TulipPours a brown mahogany in color w/ a 1/3 finger off-white head w/ medium amounts of lacing. Aromas of brown sugar, caramel, dark fruits, and a touch of cotton candy mixed w/ basement mustiness. The flavor was of brown sugar/caramel sweetness and dark fruits up front, followed by hop bite and basement mustiness, finishing w/ lingering tobacco. Medium bodied and lush w/ a bit more carbonation than I would like in an English Barley Wine. Pretty easy to drink at 11% as the ABV is very well hidden amongst the intense flavors.Overall, I was very excited to sample this long-time want! In the end, due to the higher levels of carbonation this brew really blurs the lines between English Strong Ale and English Barley Wine, but the brew has great depth of flavor and did not disappoint. This brew should age nicely and hopefully the carbonation will die down a bit making it more true to the style.Mar 17, 2013', 'thanks to ArchEnemyBrew for this beer!Vintage December 2012.poured into Tulip glass.Appearance: murky brown almost black bodied beer with red around the edges when held up to light.

I could smell this all day!Taste: The beer starts off like a scotch ale. Dark fruits and just a hint of smoke. Caramel and toffee notes that are not overly sweet. Its bready. Hint of molasses and leather. A nice dose of earthy hops that add a moderately bitter finish.Mouthfeel: medium bodied beer with moderate carbonation. Little bit of warming and ""fruity"" booze. Really nice drinking English Barleywine.Overall: This beer has alot of elements of several big beer styles including, but not limited to Scotch Ale, Barleywine, and an Old Ale. Nice drinking EBW; I think the nose is my favorite part of the beer. The hops on the back end was a nice little surprise...the nose is al malt and I didnt think that any hop flavors would be found in the taste of the beer. This also has some serious cellar potential, I think it would hold up well with age. If I had another bottle I would probably stash it away for a while to let those hops fade away.Feb 28, 2013', 'Poured into an Elysian snifter. Pours a slightly hazy medium caramel amber. Classic barleywine aroma of caramel malt, dark and dried fruit, slightly nutty and a hint of toasted malt.

A very nice classic English barleywine. I hope to get another one to cellar.Feb 19, 2013', '12 version. Very fresh tasting BW with quite a few hops making their place in the mix. Very drinkable for such a young BW which makes me wonder how it will age in the cellar.

But, the sledding is slower with less than a dozen in 2018. And the quality has dropped since distribution is more limited. (So maybe, Bob, it is time to find another list.) At any rated, Amnesiac was on the list because Phillips was an early Vancouver Island crafter to get extreme and produce a following. Amnesiac Looks inviting; a pretty pale, on the amber side with a full foam creating a nice lace over time. Smells are mostly malt and Northwest hops, seemingly to me almost as equals. (Although I prefer the fruit of a yeast working its malts to standout.) Then, Amnesiac slips into a hop assault on the buds, barely letting them taste the malt. Feel finishes too bitter for me... although not as bitter as some high-rated DIPAs I\'ve had. At any rate, I\'m ready to move on... and I won\'t forget Amnesiac is a must to avoid.Nov 14, 2018', 'Pours like another Phillips IPA I tried, the color of iced tea. Head was a bit tan. Nice lacing in this one. Nose was a bit dank. Taste was straight bitterness. Followthrough is bitter as well...for a while. Decent beer.Sep 29, 2018', 'Smells of pine and pineapple.

Finish is wonderfully citrus.Feel: Good carbonation for a Double, no alcohol hit so it doesn't feel like a DIPA in the mouth.Overall: Probably one of my go-too DIPA's.

Finish is slightly bitter but quite clean. I've had a couple of Phillips' offerings, and I'm quite favorably impressed.Jun 01, 2017"", '0ml bottle poured into a snifter.Slightly hazed orange amber color with lots of floating sediment, the pour builds up majestic fluffy off-white head that well retains itself with great retention before slowly collapsing to an everlasting silky crown that won’t die down until the last sip and leaving plenty of lacing along the way.Massive hop in the aroma, it presents with notes of tropical, citrus, grapefruit, pineapple, passion fruit, peach, floral, pine, and resin. Malt is there to leverage with its bread, dough, and slight caramel candy. The overall aroma is not that super juicy or fruity but in good balance.The taste is as well led by hop with wide varieties of flavors ranging from grass, pine, resin, grapefruit, citrus, and persistent bitterness. Malt resides in the background with only subtle bread and biscuit profile in order to let solid resiny hop bitterness dominating all over. The end and aftertaste is lasting with such bold hop bitterness and a wee hint of alcohol.Medium to full body with rather low to medium carbonation but it is crisp and lively enough to cater the palate and mouthfeel under smoothness, finish is dry.This Canadian DIPA is full and reminiscent of lively west coast hop feeling making it crisp and intense also tasty. Better than I firstly expected.Mar 15, 2017', 'Pours a clear orange body with lots of soapy head. The scent is very citrusy and tropical, with some hints of mild sweetness and dankness.

Look - quite typical for an IPA; burnt-orange, cloudy. Smell - Horrific, piercing pine and bitter grapefruit. More akin to something I would use to clean my floors than something I would drink.Taste - Bitter in the extreme, like citrus-scented soap and pine needles. Truly an awful experience that lingers way longer than one could ever wish it to.Feel - Like soapy water that's carbonated, with a slightly oily mouthfeel.Overall, this is practically the epitome of why I can't stand Phillips Brewery. There seems to be a notion over there that cramming entire fields of hops into a bottle is a good thing; that, and most of their beers seem to be only variants of the IPA style. I suppose if you are into extreme craft beers and find eating hops by the fistful a great pastime, you might enjoy this. Other than that, I fail to see how anyone could ever enjoy this.Apr 01, 2015"", ""50 mL bottle picked up at the LCBO; best before Jun 28 2015. Served slightly chilled.Pours a lightly foggy, golden-amber colour, generating a lofty head more than two fingers high. It is fluffy, puffy, and bone white in colour - quite attractive, with pretty good retention, too. It recedes gradually over a period of ten minutes or so, eventually being reduced to a lumpy, foamy cap and collar, with a complex doily-pattern of sticky lace deposited all around the glass. On the nose, I am immediately greeted with an enticing blend of tropical fruit character - citrusy orange is well-represented, in addition to pineapple juice, grapefruit, and plenty of resiny pine. While the hops are more dominant here, the malt bill is not to be forgotten, as a pronounced caramelized sugar sweetness permeates the bouquet, with faint suggestions of apricot and strawberry. Now for the most crucial bit - does it taste as good as it looks and smells? After two sips, I'd have to say 'yes, mostly'. Malty flavours of caramelized sugar and butterscotch barely manage to temper the onslaught of hoppy character. Notes of pine needles and sappy, resiny bitterness are almost overpowering, with notes of candied grapefruit and citrus pith also crossing the tongue. Not as fruity as the nose suggested - touches of apricot and pineapple do come through, but the piney flavours quickly overwhelm them. It finishes with an earthy, resiny bitterness that lingers on into aftertaste, along with some caramelized sugar and boozy sweetness. On the heftier side of medium-bodied, with soft, lightly prickly carbonation levels that result in a smooth mouthfeel that is both somewhat creamy and a bit oily. Very satisfying texture. Dangerously easy to drink, and a total pleasure to do so.Final Grade: 4.36, an astounding A grade. I'm always a bit worried when I crack open an IPA that has been shipped across the country, but Phillips' Amnesiac did not disappoint in the slightest. While I'd still love to try this one in its home turf - totally fresh - this bomber is still drinking very nicely, and if it were available locally I'd definitely be picking up another bottle or two. Not the most intense or memorable sort of DIPA I've ever had, but a respectable, very well-made one that I plan to return to in the future. Definitely worth a look - one of the grand-daddies of Canadian West Coast DIPAs, and you should always respect your elders.Mar 22, 2015"", 'Serving: 650 mL bottle poured into a nonic pint glass.Appearance: Clear, slightly amber gold. A dense, frothy white foam slowly recedes and leaves thick lacing.Smell: Bright citrus, pine needles, some herbs and slight dank.

Nose is tropical fruit, citrus, with some peppery spice. Taste follows nose. Tropical fruit at the front moving into grapefruit bitterness. There is an earthy and peppery finish. I'm not sure how fresh this is. I was expecting a lot more hops from a DIPA.Jan 25, 2015"", ""Holy hops!! I have to admit that this is one of my favourite beers and was excited to see it start the month off. It pours a nice coppery colour with and inch and half tan head that sticks to the glass. The nose hits you with a citrus hops which is followed up by a huge kick of hops on the palate. I've tried in vain finding out what the International Bitterness Unit (IBU) rating is but it has to be in the high 80's. I think this covers up some of the alcohol flavor which is subdued considering it comes in at 8.5% ABV. If you like hoppy beers this is a must try.Dec 22, 2014"", ""Pours peach orange with lots of suspended particles in a slight haze. The massive rocky head lasts forever. Piney hops and a bit of caramel malt in the nose, some booziness too. The taste is very hoppy and bitter with piney, eucalyptus and lemon hop flavors out front. A slightly roasty, nutty malty profile makes solid balance. Booze isn't incredibly well hidden for the weight, but isn't distracting. A whiff of diacetyl in the back. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a creamy carbonation. Long bitter, herbal and citrus finish.This is a nice DIPA. Super hoppy but with a bit too prominent and characterful malt profile for my tastes. Tends to distract from the hop onslaught. Still delicious stuff.

Taste: Like the aromas, it has a resiny pine bitterness, some grassiness, light citrus/grapefruit and some sweet bready/caramelly malts. Mouthfeel: It has a medium carbonation with a nice overall balance and feel. Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied by good flavors and aromas.

An OK beer a perhaps at one time this may have been a great DIPA but with so many high quality offerings available almost everywhere this is pretty lackluster.Jul 29, 2014', ""Amnesiac looks memorable enough: golden sunset in colour, twinkling highlights, fluttering bubbles, and a patch of head that leaves sea-spray patterns of lacing all up and down the glass. Full points for appearance. This ale is every bit as aesthetic as its label art. The nose is overrun by a bitter green herbalness, as it arguably should be. There's a lot of pine-like resins and bitter, festering tropical fruit skin qualities; this smells like brown lime and mushy lemons, all coated in a sticky tree sap substance. The malts also impart a scorched caramel note. The ale isn't much easier on the palate, impressing a combination of cutting citrus acidity, raw onion-like pungency, a pinch of fresh-grated ginger-like zest, and burnt butterscotch. Overall it's a considerably bitter mouthfeel, with little to soften the sizable IBU count. That said, there are redeeming shortbread cookie and biscuit notes, as well as caramelized grapefruit, grilled pineapple, and spiced orange peel flavours. It's a highly flavourful ale, there's no question, but not everyone will be able to stomach the 8.5% alcohol and accompanying intensity. Amnesiac is a beer good enough to remember having. In fact, I still have vivid memories of the last time I reviewed it, just over 8 years ago. Having had countless more incredible DIPAs in the time since I still like it now about as much as I did then. It's a good one, that's for sure.Jul 28, 2014"", ""650ml bottle from the lcbo. $5.95 served slightly chilled in a snifter.A- Clear copper color with a white head of sticky foam.

One of the better IPAs on the Western Canadian scene in terms of flavor complexity and the hops are not subtle although this does qualify as a moderate hop bomb. Pours a nice amber/weak orange juice hue with about three fingers of straw-colored foam. Aroma skews towards the orange end of citrus, fermented pineapple, some harsh woody and resin notes, sweet caramel malt. Taste is an amazing layered cocktail of grapefruit, lemon, lime, brown sugar, cashews, pine resin. The body is surprisingly light for a double IPA but there is some of the classic stickiness and oil. Sure enough the bitterness emerges after the citrus fruit and it actually hits you in the bag a bit after that fruit/nut beginning. The alcohol is almost completely masked and one could imagine getting plastered on this in short order (not that most sane individuals do a double IPA session). With each taste there seems to be a different emphasis, about halfway through there was a lot of lime, later on there were some bitter nut flavors (walnuts?) and earthy alkaline spice almost like turmeric. Several beer books describe cinnamon which I didn\'t get at all, perhaps this is just my palate. There\'s spice all right, it was just more earthy than sweet brown spice to me. This is a top tier brew in my book and a really nice balance between hoppy power and aromatic elegance. A beautiful weapon like a samurai sword.Aug 05, 2013', 'A - Clear straw/amber. 1 finger of head that quickly faded.

Head slowly faes to a nice foam cap and coats the sides of the glass. A hazy gamboge orange in color with no carbonation evident. A thin wisp remains until the end and leaves lots of nice lacing down the glass. Really nice looking beer. SMELL: Nice, big nose of pale malts, caramel, honeydew melon and plenty of nice citrus, hoppy aromas. Grapefruit, orange peel and lemon for sure. Fruity, bold, and very enticing. TASTE: Plenty hoppy again, and lives to the nose for sure. Pale and caramel malts up front, then lots of citrus fruit at the swallow. Grapefuit, orange peel, lots of pineapple and honeydew melon, as well as some nice lemon zest for sure. Big and lingering aftertaste of pineapple and honeydew melon sweetness, as well as lots of bitter grapefruit and lemon flavors. This is flavorful and enjoyable. PALATE: Medium body and medium levels of carbonation. Semi-creamy smooth on the palate, goes down smooth and finishes slightly oily and mouth-coating on the palate. A bitter bite lingers as well. Nice and oily feel, though it needs to be a little creamier for top marks here. OVERALL: An excellent IPA for sure. Lots of big, fruity, hoppy aromas and flavors on this one; another great example of the awesome beer that is coming out of BC at the moment. A slightly creamier palate would have helped support the flavors a bit more and really brough this one to the promise land, but regardless, this is a top quiality beer that I'd love to drink again.

As it warms, I am even able to detect some nice fruity pear, melon and apple on the nose as well - very cool. Taste is nutty and bready as it hits your mouth. Then, mid-sip, the hops show their strength, coming through with some nice bitter, piney notes and finishing with a very smooth, maple sugar flavour with just a touch of dry-hopped bitterness on the linger. The alcohol is somewhat noticeable. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and somewhat chewy with a very nice crisp spiciness to it throughout with a pretty clean, dry finish.

A number of years ago, on a different visit to Van City, Amnesiac was the first DIPA that I ever had, so I suppose I owe it a fair bit of credit in my evolving beer education.This beer pours a slightly hazy, but still bright medium golden amber hue, with two hefty fingers of puffy, foamy, and chunky eggshell white head, which leaves a decent array of spooky layered cloud lacing around the glass as it slowly sinks out of sight.It smells of musty pine needles, grapefruit rind, bready, crackery caramel malt, and a further floral, leafy hoppiness. The taste has an even more pungent pine resin and grapefruit extract bitterness, semi-sweet, bready caramel malt, a touch of stale toffee, a bit of indistinct melon fruitiness, lemon polish, and additional floral, perfumed hops. The carbonation is on the low, understated side, the body an adequate medium weight, with a creamy, somewhat pervasive oiliness. It finishes quite dry, the bristling alcohol spinning above and around the persistent hops, all in the face of an increasingly battered malt offset.I found this very easy to drink, as usual - not an overwrought hop-bomb, rather an appropriately dialed back, yet still heady West Coast Canadian expression of the style. Too bad I've only been able to find it during trips to that area of the country.

Notched for November, and opened in time, if it means consume-by. A fluffy, slightly peach head perches atop an amber-tinted brown body, bubbles lazily rising upward. Moderate floral aroma with a bit of pine resin is somewhat inviting, though not exciting. The flavor profile follows -- a pine/grass bitterness guided along by an earthy grain base, with very subtle hints of citrus zest. Underpowered for a double IPA, flavorwise, but hides the alcohol very well, and favors a medium body while providing refreshment. Goes down smooth, and does not linger as long as it should. Easily quaffable but easily forgettable, which is a shame since it is a quality brew.Nov 20, 2007', 'Bottle: Poured a deep dirty amber and hazy ale with a nice foamy head with some great retention and some good lacing. Aroma of bitter hops is dominating with some subtle notes of resin hops. Taste is also dominated by some bitter hops with some light resin notes.

The Cascade hops own the show, and they are accomodating. The malt profile is basic, and appears once the ale has really warmed up, caramel and crystal malt it seems. A soapy, piney aftertaste to it.Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, creamy and full in places, rounded, yet leaves a rather watery impression overall. An okay IPA, yet doesn\'t live up to the ""double"" title in my opinion. The abv% does hit home under the radar after a while though, which lends it a bit more credence. An enjoyable beer nonetheless for those who like their hops.Jul 22, 2007', 'Bottle courtesy of CBA- thanks man! Pours out cloudy orange brown. Fairly good off white head. Aroma is earthy malt and hops. Taste- follows the aroma. Not a big west coast style DIPA, moreso almost british like. Malt is solid- tobacco and dusty, but no big hop bite. Booze is well hidden and drinkability is decent. Not too many canadian dipa\x92s out there , so I tip my hat.Jul 20, 2007', '0ml bomberPoured a hazey honey colored ale in the glass with a decent 2 finger sticky cap... good retention and great lacing qualities.Aroma: half way to a Pacific NW IPA; some citrus from cascades but also some musty grassy cedar tones from fuggles, and other Brit varieties...all with a big caramel-toffee malt undertone.Profile: Big chew on juicy citrus rind hops and toffee malts in the front side....mid palate some woody-earth notes, cedar, walnut skins, toast...finish throws the balance off to slightly favor the hops but it is subtle enough and the malts are thick enough it is not a problem.Covers the alcohol completely...a big malty-hoppy IPA..very flavourful, satisfying and drinkable..well doneJun 10, 2007', 'Poured a nice amber colour, slightly cloudy. Nice big, off-white head that lasted the entire glass. Good lace.Smells of fresh American hops. Green, floral, grassy. Slight citrus, resinous, spicy, but not nearly as much as I expected. Smell of malt is more subdued. Slightly sweet and grainy. Faint alcohol, but well hidden for 8.5%.Moderate body and carbonation that lasts throughout the tasting.Dominant taste is the green, grassy, floral hops. Again, not as much resinous or citrus as expected. Slightly sweet but the malt character balances well with the hops. That green hop bitterness lingers on the tongue but its not in a ""I need to scrape my tongue before my next beer"" kind of way.Extremely well balanced and very drinkable considering other beers of the style.May 12, 2007', ""This is my favourite IPA(double or single) of all time.A-Beautiful copper reddish-brown. Clear. Veeery fluffy white head that lingers for a few minutes. Be careful with your pour.S-This beer smells delicious. Huge hop aroma with orange and tangerine notes. I detect a little bit of maltiness in the aroma as well.T-Like I said, this is my favourite beer. The hoppiness is huge but not overly bitter. There is a hoppy sweetness along with a slight maltiness that takes the edge off the sometimes overly aggressive hop flavours you get in other IPA's. M-There is definately some carbonation to this beer. It lends itself well, however, to the aggressive flavours. It wakes up the pallette and facilitates the exceptionally strong and aromatic flavours. Alcohol is well hidden. D-Almost scary. Since the alcohol is nearly undectable, this goes down like water. I'd almost say it's more drinkable than Phillip's regular IPA.Overall- Amazing craft brew that is reminiscent of some of the Western American IPA's out there today. I am very impressed with Matt Phillips' brews.Dec 03, 2006"", ""A - Clear dark copper. Head is smallish, but is creamy and laces well. Head recedes to a thin cover, but retains quite well at that level.S - Aroma is a touch sweet and floral hops. Seems to be a slight nuttiness and soy sauce and toasty grain aromas as well.T - Flavour is heavy maltiness, but not sweet, and a hop kick. Bitterness lingers for a good long time. M - Thick, rich and creamy.D - Most certainly not a session beer. Quite a heavy beer, but the first few sips are quite refreshing. Tasty, but doesn't have the hop profile I expected.

Orange, creamy head, sweet malty and hoppy odor, but not as much of a hop leaf or even hop oil smell as i expected. Taste was quite hoppy and also slightly syrupy. Very sweet too, a bit much so. Thick mouthfeel, too sweet and cloying i think to drink a whole lot of.Jul 26, 2006', ""Love the name and label. Fortunately it's a winner in the glass too.Pours a copper color with a thick foamy head. Laces like a Belgian ale: sticky and lots of it.Aroma brings forth a sweetness that's candylike, also with good hops and spice presence. All faint but certainly likeable.Flavor gives a grapefruit twang up front (praise the hops), along with a robust malt balance. The candylike essence remains in the flavor, though never annoyingly rich or sweet. This even has an edge that reminds of a barley wine. Perhaps that's the hops/malt/alcohol balance, all which are at the forefront of this great double IPA.Mouthfeel is on the watery side, but not too thin. More silky smooth than carbonated.A seriously impressive double IPA that should NOT be overlooked amidst the multitudes of stylistically similar beers.Jul 05, 2006"", 'Appearance \x96 This beer pours a nice amber with deep orange aspects to it. There is a decent amount of frothy whitish head which has a strong staying power. There is an abundant amount of lacing as well. Smell \x96 The smell is nice. The hop presence is unbelievable. It\x92s very strong of flowers and citrus fruits and also has a slight sweet honey aroma. I can also sense minor bread like scents too. Taste \x96 Up front you wouldn\x92t think this is a double IPA. The bitterness doesn\x92t make itself as known when the beer is in your mouth. When first sipped I sense slight a slight bread sensation with a bit of fruitiness and sweetness. Once the beer was swallowed I was bombarded by floral and citrus hops with an extreme bitterness. Mouthfeel \x96 The finish was a little dry for me personally. The carbonation was touch low but nothing that bad. Body was nice but a little more wouldn\x92t hurt.Drinkability \x96 I like my hops\x85but this one might have had a little too much bitterness making it one to drink in limited quantities.May 10, 2006', ""Pours very orange and clear, like a dull version of orange Crush. A Rocky off-white head formed more than one finger thick, and left plenty of lacing on the glass.The smell is very flowery and full of citrus. I smell a bit of sweet lemonade. As it warms it leans more towards the citrus side. Overall it is a very fresh smell, and pretty inviting.In the mouth is a balance of flowery sweetness and bitterness, but once you swallow the hops hit fairly big. Each mouthfull leaves the back of the mouth full of bitter flavour, with a touch of citrus tucked in.I found it to be a bit thin, and the carbonation felt a little flat. I would have liked this one to be a bit more lively in the mouth.It is a good beer, but my palate won't take it for long. I don't mind the hops, but I don't see my taste for it lasting more than one glass of this one.May 09, 2006"", 'I have to join the choir of praise for this one. The Swedish government liqour store Systembolaget had a graphic taste indication system with a circle for each taste. The more taste, the fuller the circle. If you use something like this on Amnesia all the circles are full. My wife brought me two bottles from Canada. They poured with a swirl of bubbles and with a beautiful chestnut color. Two fingers of creamy foam. Had that typical sharp IPA smell. The taste is BITTER, strong and surprisingly bready in the end. Great stuff, full of character.May 03, 2006', ""2/28/05- Purchased at a BC Provincial Liquor Store in Kelowna, B.C.Presentation- 22oz bottle with a dating strip on the bottom. Was this brewed in the second week of October, or do I have a beer that was brewed in Oct 2002??? Poured into my Duvel tulip.Appearance- Amber, slight clouded pour. Decent amount of yeast sediment jump around in the glass. 3/4 inch head at first, but immediately turns to no head within seconds. No lacing to be found here.Smell- The scent is fine. Lots of grapefruit and pine hops mixed together with a what seems like solid caramel malted base.Taste- Fair hop to malt balance. First the malt sets in leaving you with a medium toasted taste as well as a caramel flavor. The hops are pretty bitter. Mostly a sharp grapefruit aspect that leaves a long after bitter taste.Mouthfeel- Very low, almost no carbonation. Seems as it's approaching cask style. Think this bottle may be a bit old?Drinkability- Taste was decent enough, this may have really been a hophead brew when it was fresh. Seemed really flat though. Would like to try a fresh one some day.Dec 29, 2005"", 'A nicely balanced approach to the style.A: Copper-bronze, darker than most (similar to Hercules DIPA). Fluffy off-white head, great retention and lace.S: Bready, caramel malt, with a fresh, floral hop aroma. A hint of citrus, but doesn\'t scream ""Pacific Northwest"".T: Bready and caramel malt flavour is well balanced with hop bitterness. Nice hop flavour that\'s assertive, but not overwhelming, and still allows sufficient malt flavour to come through. Some Northwest citrus flavour, but it\'s smooth, well-rounded, and integrated with the rest of the brew. Alcohol is well hidden!M: Body is quite full, slightly creamy and acidic. Moderate to high carbonation (keeps feeding the head).D: It\'s good. It\'s a big brew, but it\'s not overwhelming. Very well balanced.I think this is my favourite Double IPA. It\'s a big brew, that still retains some balance. I highly recommend it.Dec 26, 2005', 'Pours a clear dark brown/orange, big off white head forms and laces amazingly. Smell is super hops, lots of grapefruit, citrus and piney floral, some carmale, bread and a little alcohol. Taste is very hoppy, caramel and pine, with citrus/grapefruit in the middle, buttery but the flavour weakens as time passes, very dry and bitter. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, low carbonation, smooth and tasty, although I found the bitterness to be a little unbalanced. However this beer is a bargain, $4.40 per bomber at the BCLS.Dec 24, 2005', 'Dark rugged amber with a nice head of off-white foam that leaves nice lacing on my glass. Aromas are hoppy, but nothing like the hop bombs that are available in the western states! Still nice US hop nose with some nice biscuity buttery caramel malts to back it all up. Taste is hoppy up front but the malts soften out the big bad flavors of grapefruit, pine, other citrus fruits, hop oils, resins, and other alpha acidy notes. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and drinkability is very good. A good double IPA by US standard. A first for Canada, and a kick ass double ipa for BC standards! Nice stuff...Jul 17, 2005', ""Clear, ruddy caramel amber colour, plenty of lacing and good retention, slightly rocky cream coloured head. Very nice to look at. Perfumy hop aroma, floral, pine, light citrus, grassy. Some maltiness as well. Balance in the flavour is this beer's real strength. Caramel malty sweetness provides a nice foundation for moderately strong bitterness and complex hop flavour that's very similar to the aroma profile. Finishes dry due to the hopping rate, but doesn't feel astringent. Full, creamy texture and moderately full body with medium carbonation. Very easy to drink for a DIPA. A great Canadian beer enjoyed on Canada Day!Jul 03, 2005"", ""I do love the bitter.It poured out surprisingly cloudy and golden, with a huge hoppy nose. All I could smell was floral hops and herby goodness. A decent but thinnish head floated on top, with a bit of nice lace left on the glass as I got through the pint. The flavour is incredibly hoppy -- not just bitter, but lots of piney and grapefruity resinous flavour as well. Underneath it all, a strong honey flavour builds. The honey lingers between swallows, with a very sturdy bitterness backing it all up. It's nicely balanced between the sweetness and the bitterness. It's smooth and easy drinking.Nicely done, Phillips.Jun 13, 2005"", ""Had at Volo Cafe last night. Mighty smooth! A label with expiry date choices until the end of 2004 concerned me, but it didn't matter. A 650 bomber with nice foam, lace.

Alcohol evident also.Creamy mouthfeel with a snappy crispness and juicy citrus fruits.A surprising amount of hops for a Canadian brew, but a bit on the subdued side by US standards for a IIPA.Finishes with a lingering bitterness and a metallic aftertaste.Alcohol warms as the hops linger on the pallet,drying and tart.Tasty brew, a freshy would be exceptional.Would love to have one on tap.Apr 04, 2005"", 'Matt Phillips I applaud you for having the first Double IPA in BC and not having it suck.

One of his best beers and a landmark in BC brewing.Jan 17, 2005', 'My first foray into an India pale ale; I\'ve never bothered with any other brand and only bought this on recommendation of a liquor store employee.It pours a cloudy golden brown colour with a big white head. Decent lacing with big bits of foam even halfway through It smells of hops (the bottle states the beer has a ""mind blowing amount of hops"") and not much else; faint hints of fruit, almost like strawberries.The taste is bitter, with mostly hops and pretty much nothing else. This isn\'t entirely bad, but it comes off as somewhat one dimensional. Fizzy, but it doesn\'t feel overly carbonated. Fairly tasty, but again a bit one dimensional and the rather high ABV and bottle size will limit this beer\'s ability to be a ""session beer"".Dec 16, 2004']",https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/2675/21164/

I was particularly interested in this brew after how great Switchback was, some very nice Kiwi hopping in a pungent West Coast IPA. Straight up, this is Switchback's big brother, similarly tropical but with even more massive pine/cough lozenge hops, particularly in the finish. Aroma is one of the more pineapple- and guava forward in recent memory, decidedly musky, tropical and sweet ... Huge guava presence accompanied by toffee and gummy candy notes. Palate is more of the same coupled with navel orange and grapefruit juice, a little licorice. The hops come off like an amped up Red Racer albeit less floral and more tropical. This one evolves away from the bright and sweet fruit flavors into a pine/spruce forest, intensely resinous and bitter by the end (not a criticism, although seriously, this thing gets medicinal). Very low carbonation adds to a syrupy sweet mouthfeel that gets scrubbed away during the resinous finish. Not a ton of malt presence although there is a little toast and toffee.

The taste is bready, crackery caramel malt, a touch of sourdough, more peppy fruit salad (grapefruit, orange, and lime, mostly), hints of grocery aisle tropical fruit, a minor stoney flintiness, and further floral, mildly perfumed hops.The bubbles are average in their frothy goings-on, the body a sturdy medium-heavy weight for the style, and fairly smooth, with a soft fruity creaminess growing as it warms. It finishes a bit on the sweet side, the caramel malt gaining some toffee outgrowths, while the bitterness of the still heady hops starts to lose serious ground to the equally inherent fruity side of their nature.One pleasantly rendered, big and hoppy, and at the same time beefy and malty DIPA. The amped-up ABV is well integrated, making this just a touch too easy to drink, the appreciation of the well engineered simplicity of it all going to waste when it goes down so readily!

Minimal and sticky off white head created on a two finger pour. Settles down fairly quickly.Aroma has excellent phenolic and hop mixed character. Nice small spicy clove tones, but with a good juicy banana and mixing citrus fruit quality, and flirting with tropical hop notes as well. Good sense of chewy wheat malt on the nose, and hints at a solid depth. A bit of clash and fighting for space, but not a bad marriage of the two between hop and yeast.Palate seems to hint at something more elaborate, but for the most part sticks to solid basics. Chewy and with a bit of light body, but supportive on the palate of the flavors. Mix of hop citrus and banana, with an actual almost chewy clove character that you can bite down on. Soft bodied finish and hitting with a thick dough quality that almost rises in the mouth upon the swallow.Neat take on a hop forward hefe, but there's some minor magic missing in the style and some character deducted by a unique hop profile that while good sticks out kind of oddly.Oct 05, 2017"", '5/24/17....pours bright gold with a thin layer of white foam.

The nose is...wonderful. Fresh hops and tropical fruit are prominent with the Hefe yeast sneaking in with its banana yeasty character....is that a slight hint of bubblegum?The taste is far more IPA - and a good one. But there is that Hefe character lingering in the background that makes this a uniquely tasty beer.Apr 27, 2016', ""650ml bottle, @7% ABV. Nice name and imagery for a hoppy hefeweizen, I suppose.This beer pours a slightly hazy, medium golden amber colour, with four pudgy fingers of puffy, loosely foamy, and bubbly ecru head, which leaves some chunky splattered lace around the glass as things slowly sink away.It smells of musty and sort of phenolic yeast, bready and doughy pale and wheat malt, muddled tropical fruit (ok, maybe some overripe pineapple and blood orange), a gentle earthy white pepper spiciness, and more leafy, herbal, and floral green hop bitters. The taste is semi-sweet, grainy pale malt, some equally saccharine wheatiness, a thankfully dialed-back gritty and spicy yeast essence, still hard to differentiate exotic fruity esters, and more zippy leafy, floral, and mildly piney hoppiness.The carbonation is fairly understated in its gentle and barely probing frothiness, the body a solid middleweight, and mostly smooth, as the hops here seem to know just when to take a well-earned breather. It finishes on the sweet side, but moderated well enough by yeast, spice, and verdant hops alike.Overall, this is certainly a tasty and engaging version of this pseudo-style (I for one would back the addition of hopfenweisse to the database here), where the hops don't quite overtake the base hefe, but they do come close. Anyways, all that mixed tropical fruitiness goes a long way in rendering this a superb summer-time patio staple - just watch that 14-proof booze - it's oh so sneaky!Apr 19, 2016"", ""50ml bomber poured into tulip 12/4/16A slight haze in a golden yellow body but I can still clearly read these words through the glass, two fingers of foam has great retention and leaves several partial rings S pineapple, lychee, passion fruit, guava, sweet orange, tropical fruit punch with a little banana, clove, and bubblegum, from the hefe yeast, smells amazing T still more of an IPA then anything, yes I'm getting a little dry cereal and hefe yeast but for the most part its tropical notes with some pine, and I'm loving itM heavy for a hefe but I'm struggling to call it that, mild bitter bite, not quite creamy but plenty of bubbles, leaning towards oily, citrus peel and a little banana on the finish O I've almost taken down the bomber at this point and I haven't been typing that long, super drinkable, crazy hoppy, crazy good all around, stoked on this stuffYou can't really call this a Hefeweizen and I'm not rating it as such.

It smells of pungent tropical fruit - pineapple, ripe red grapefruit, and mango - a sort of buttered bready maltiness, gentle cheesy funky notes, a bit of peppery yeastiness, and further indistinct juicy citrus flesh. The taste is semi-sweet, bready and doughy pale and wheat malt, some lesser weird alterna-graininess, a more sedate exotic fruitiness (blood orange and lemon rind, passionfruit, and maybe a hint of banana), and some almost faded Brett and generic yeasty funkiness.The carbonation is quite low-key in its wan-seeming frothiness, the body a decent medium weight, and generally smooth, nothing really aiding or detracting from the cause here.

Aromatics: A little mellow, apricot, and mild but very present vinuous and cider/vinegar sour attributes and some good oak/wodden notes in there under the wine.Taste: It is very tame for a sour, and like @Derek says, needs a bit more funk. It has a very shallow field of flavours which are mostly in the milder stone fruits apricot, mango, under-ripe cherry variety - not as sweet as say peach. The red-wine and oak contributing their own flavours which starts to deepen the flavours of the fruit but doesn\'t go too far. (Maybe it should?) But it is still looking for those deeper characters.Mouth: Very carbonated, making it very crisp and kinda distracts you from its weight which is an ok medium. The palate gets a good wash of activity and acidic tang. Overall: A decent enough mellow and easy to drink brew, maybe a bit too mild for me.

A good balance between crusty bread, light spices and a little tingle on the tongue. One thing I found interesting is that this one has the same hard-to-place savory element in the finish and flavor that I got in another similar beer I had the other day, so maybe it is just me.

Purchased from the LCBO for around $3 CDN. Let's see if this red ale lives up to some of the other beers in Central City's portfolio.Appearance - Very clear amber / red in color. Impressive finger and change of ivory head, loads of sticky lacing left behind. Plenty of carbonation and impressive retention. Great looking beer.Smell - Some graininess initially with a wallop of hops backing. Astringent, piney and intense. Basically smells like a Red Racer beer.Taste - Starts initially bitter and as you prepare for the hop wallop, the beer lets its foot of the gas, and everything just kind of fades away. Hops return with some grainy flavors, and a briefly metallic flavor makes itself present. Still very good, just a bit of a let down.Mouthfeel - Smooth, a little bit oily (you can feel the hop oils in this one), expressive carbonation. Keeps the tongue singing. Body is fairly light.Overall - Central City has created another delicious beer with generous hops, just enough graininess to keep things balanced and a wonderful aroma and feel to alongside this.

Grainy, bready malts and caramel sweetness on the nose, with added notes of pine resin, muddled grapefruit and some leafy, floral hops. Taste follows the nose fairly closely; reminiscent of their regular IPA, albeit much more malt-forward. Bready malts, caramel and biscuit sweetness come through at first, but as one might expect the hops take over the back end. Grapefruit, clementine, pine resin and a hint of pineapple, developing into a more floral, dank bitterness at the finish. Fruity, bittersweet aftertaste that lingers briefly. Light-medium in body, with middling carbonation levels and a smooth, somewhat slick mouthfeel. Final Grade: 3.93, a B+. Red Racer's India Style Red Ale doesn't quite match up to their flagship IPA, but it's still a very well-made amber ale. It's my understanding that they used to call this an ESB, and I for one am glad that they re-branded it, because it has very little in common with other examples of that style - this is an American-style beer, through and through, and there's no point trying to pass it off as anything else.

Looks like dark orange to brownish honey with a moderate amount of off-white head. Aroma is very assertive from a hops standpoint, mixed citrus (orange, tangerine, lime) and a caramel nutty sweetness to provide some degree of balance. This is certainly a hops-forward take on the ESB style, although there is a nutty, toasted malt character as well that does not need too much effort to ascertain. Mixed nuts (walnut, hazelnut), oil seed, and brown bread underlie a decent bouquet of floral and citrus-flavored/orange breakfast drink evoking West Coast hops ... Citrus rind and some mellow pine take the lead but the malts do add a toffee character that keeps things anchored within stylistic guidelines. Body and mouth feel both comfortably in the middle.

With a reasonable show of malts in both the scent and the taste I was hoping for a thicker mouth feel O: A hop forward E.S.B.typical of the Red Racer taste.

Cheers! From a 355ml can into a snifterAPPEARANCE: Pours a two finger, medium looking, fluffy, off-white head with good retention. Head is a touch loose perhaps, but fades slowly to a nice, full wisp. Clear burnt orange in color with a few floaties and no carbonation evident. A splotchy wisp remains leaving some dots of lacing down the glass. SMELL: Quite hoppy for the style. Citrus and orange notes, lemon, and some toffee malt aromas. A touch of butterscotch as well, but this is quite hop forward for the style. The ESB is there, but it\'s more of a hoppy ale than anything. Still nice, however. TASTE: Taste follows the nose, but the malty sweetness makes a better showing here. A touch of toffee up front, but unfortunately a little empty in flavor before the swallow. The flavor picks up afterwards with more toffee, butterscotch, dark bread and soem light floral notes at teh finish. Bold and persistent aftertaste os sweet butterscotch, bread, and some floral hop bitterness. PALATE: Lighter body and higher levels of carbonation. Light on the palate, too light really, a bit airy going down, and finishes a touch dry on the palate. Too light and carbonated for the style. OVERALL: This was nice, but a little too hoppy for the style perhaps, especially in the nose. It\'s like this one wants to be an IPA but unwantingly got ""ESB"" stamped on it. The palate needs to be stepped up as well. Still, and enjoyable beer, but in the name of honesty, I think I\'ll stick with their IPA from now on. Especially if I can get their imperial IPA again.

I am watching the Rams/Stillers game on TV and thanks to my CANadian trading partner, BigBry, I have a new CAN of CANadian beer to add to The CANQuest (TM), plus it marks the return of my old buddy, Red Racy! Frequent readers of my salacious reviews CAN tell you that I am unabashed in terms of my redhead fetish and the boys in Surrey, B.C., CANada seem to be catering to me. Ride on, Red Racy and happy holidays to you, doll!From the CAN: ""The use of Crystal malts lends Central City\'s Extra Special Bitter its flavour and colour profile. Tempered with hops from the United Kingdom, this English bitter is an appetizer on its own, or a great accompaniment for any hearty dishes. \'Cheers!"" I had an exciting Crack & Glug as I was overanxious to see Red Racy and I nearly had an overflow as the head rushed up in the glass. The tawny head was the stuff of which dreams are made - three (!)-plus fingers topped by peaks resembling the top of a meringue pie or whipped cream atop an ice cream sundae with excellent retention. Red Racy never disappoints! Color was a deep-orangish copper with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a welcome piney bitterness, very appropriate for a home sans tree. The lacing that began to appear was going to require a jackhammer to remove. Mouthfeel was medium and the coolness of the hops was intense at first, but nicely balanced out by the presence of a malty sweetness. The finish was quite dry, breathtaking, literally, thanks to the intensity of the hops. Oh, Red Racy, I love you! Thank you for riding by on Christmas Eve 2011 and I look forward to more run-ins next year.Dec 24, 2011', 'Almost clean and golden-amber in colour, finger of frothy off-white head. Red Racer hops in an ESB? Lychee, guava, grapefruit, caramel. Smells more like their IPA than their pale ale does. The nose has a ton of similarity to the IPA but the flavour here is different enough. The ""Central City"" hops are still perceptible but they switch it up a little here with some dark earthy bitterness in the foreground, overshadowing the fresh tropical fruit from the IPA. Lots of hops here to be sure but there are enough distinguishing features to know it\'s an ESB (lighter malt body and more prominent minerals). Fairly well-balanced with an enjoyable amount of caramel malt (including some roasted character), with the bitter finish winning out in the end. Nice thick medium body with an active moderate carbonation. This stuff is extremely drinkable. One of my favorite ESBs I\'ve had. If you\'re looking for a lighter alternative to the IPA, pick this stuff up instead of the pale ale. I would totally buy this stuff if it were available here.

The ABV is 5.6 not 6.5 as stated above, so it's nicely sessionable, available in BC and tasty, and will do in a pinch when the Central City IPA is not available or too strong.Nov 16, 2009"", ""On-tap at the Alibi Room, as part of a three-round face-off between a number of different draft selections there. In three rounds of four beers each, the ESB clearly came out on top, ahead of perennial favourites such as Red Racer IPA and Driftwood Farmhand. A well-rounded, extraordinarily favourful and balanced bitter, equally suited for savouring and sessioning. As fine as their IPA is, it pales (no pun intended) in comparison to the ESB. If they can get this into bottles (correction: cans, I suppose) I'd drive across the border regularly to get my fix. Well done, Central City!Oct 05, 2009"", ""On-Tap at the Alibi Room...March 1, 2009Part of a 4 glass taster.Appearance: Poured a smooth copper coloured orange. No head retained but some on the pour.Smell: I can smell some hops and quite a bit of caramel. The hops are grassy and the caramel is, well, burnt-sugar, like caramel should be.Taste: Quite a bitter beer, obviously. This tastes almost like Central City's Red Racer Pale Ale. Lots of hops and some great sweetness at the end. The caramel taste is almost of candied yams on Thanksgiving.Mouthfeel: Such a smooth beer. It's velvety and pleasantly prickly on the tongue. The bitterness is definitely apparent at the back of the tongue.Drinkability: Smooth and full bodied, this would make a great beer enjoy on a hot day by the beach. Overall: Personally, I would rather have the aggressiveness of the Empire IPA, but for what it is, the ESB is very enjoyable and delivers what it should.Mar 01, 2009"", ""Had this on tap at The Railway Club which is the only place other than Central City to get this beer. Gerry Lohin is the old Sailor Hagar's Brewmaster and his Empire IPA was the hit of the Hop Festival last March at Dix.This is a first class ESB that echoes Elysian's version in its hop punch and balance.

Smells dessert like for sure!T- The licorice is there, but is much softer on the palate than the aromas would have suggested....for this i'm actually quite happy!

Next, following closely to the malted flavors an aromas is the wonderful smoothness of a well blended coffee! Mind you... a dark roast, but so incredibly butted to the malt that I almost missed it. However, once my taste buds grabbed a hold of the subtle current... every sip after seemed to pull it out even more! Thirdly, and living up to its name... ANISE! LOTS AND LOTS OF ANISE! Lastly, is a slight hoppy bitterness that tones the sweetness of the malt and sugars to PERFECTION! What rocks the most is that the longer it sits in your glass... the smoother it becomes! My next WARNING is that it IS a high grav brew @ 10% ABV, so be careful... IT HAS A KICK!

Beer is thick, chewey, bready, has good balance for a while between the dry, roasted malts (bordering on burnt) and licorice and touches of dark chocolate with a slightly boozy finish. This is a good beer but, aside from the 1 liter bottle being too much, the licorice starts to overpower everything as I keep drinking and it is not something that I could keep drinking as time went on.Feb 11, 2014', 'Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color ale with a relatively large foamy head with good retention and some good lacing.

We drank a relatively fresh 2012 vintage in the summer of 2013 and I found it much too licorice forward. I have higher hopes for this 2011 in January 2014. From a 1L capped swing-top bottle into a snifterVintage: 2011IBU: 7523 Plato APPEARANCE: A clear brown pour yields a two finger, thicker looking, fluffy, tan head with great retention. Clear black body with slightly higher levels of carbonation evident. Head fades to a full foam cap. A slight ring with a few dots of wisp remain but leave no real lacing down the glass. Decent looking, but a little too light in color, much like their Pothole Filler. SMELL: Light roasted notes, dark chocolate, light molasses and some anise on the nose. Definite licorice, but not the bomb that the 2012 was a while back. This one is actually really well balanced at this point. TASTE: Light licorice with some roasted grain and sweet molasses up front, then some dark chocolate bitterness and more roasted grain at the swallow. Medium but lingering aftertaste is roasted with bitter chocolate, sweet caramel and molasses, and some definite minty anise flavor. Like this nose, this vintage is quite well balanced at this point and actually quite enjoyable. PALATE: Medium body and medium carbonation. Creamy on the palate, enough weight, goes down smooth and finishes a touch mouth coating. Good feel. Just like Pothole Filler actually. OVERALL: I liked this way, way more than I thought I would. The fresher 2012 vintage was pretty much a drain pour for me, but I easily finished this whole 1L over the course of an evening. The anise has subsided considerably (or perhaps it was more in tune to begin with), and what we have now is a very nice imperial stout with some hints of licorice in there for good measure. Nowhere near the undrinkable anise bomb I was expecting. If you've got a 2011 and are waiting for a good time, this is the time.

The pour is black with a surprisingly peppy head curling from the top of the brew. Nose is drowning in several klafters of bad-guy licorice with a side of anise: yizza. Like a molten field of black licorice. Megadestroyer is singular, as I've never tasted anything in its weight class. Licorice follows the nose down the throat, but it's cut with plenty of hot-tar roast. Anise is a bit stronger than I'd like, & accentuates the oral licorice assault. Slightly sensed leftovers include cocoa, vanilla, with a nice drying bitterness mid-palate. But the end is all about the Red Vines. Very thick. And strangely drinkable, as my sips often turn into glugs, complete with sound effects. An interesting beer that's hard to judge using conventional methods. Not a beer I need to drink everyday, but a very good one, & a worthy experiment.Sep 24, 2013"", ""1L bottle bought at Lennox Liquor Store for $9.65 + deposit.Appearance: black, impenetrable to light, with a massive light brown head that's quite slow to dissipate. Smell: licorice (from the anise), some booziness, not much else. Definitely appealing, and rather unusual.Taste: loads of licorice flavour, some sweetness from the molasses. I think it seems less bitter because of the licorice flavour, which either makes the bitterness less pronounced or more expected. Mouthfeel: thick. Probably about what you'd expect from a beer made with blackstrap molasses. Not overly carbonated.Overall: with flavour so pronounced and ABV of 10%, this isn't something I'd want to drink often or very much of at once. I kind of wish it were available in a smaller bottle, but it would be fine if you had a friend (or two) to share a bottle with. I'm very glad I tried it, but I probably wouldn't have it again anytime soon. I might like it to be a bit more complex, but it is what it is.Jun 12, 2013"", ""Served slightly chilled into a snifter.Pours black with half an inch of light brown head that slowly recedes leaving heavy surface layer and lacing.Heavy aromas of anise.Flavors are all bittersweet. Heavy on the anise with hints of dark roasted coffee and dark chocolate.Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Sweet finish with strong but quickly fading aftertaste.A nice, flavorful beer. I have had other licorice stouts where the licorice is too mild if not altogether unnoticeable. Not very complex, but focuses on it's flavor profile.

This is one bad-ass label, the name and austere Soviet iconography setting the tone with a sledgehammer.This beer pours a dictionary-definition black, with the slightest of slight pencil-thin basal cola 'highlights', and two beefy fingers of densely foamy, rocky beige head, which leaves perfectly consistent drop-down speckled drip patterns of painted lace around the glass as it very slowly abates.It smells of musty, dusty, Zellers-going-out-of-business black licorice, middling dry cocoa, bittersweet cupboard-bound raw molasses, soft day-old coffee notes, and a latent black fruit infused caramel malt - good, sure, but a bit over the top, and I can't believe I'm saying that. The taste is ethereal anise, with a near cousin, more quotidian packaged black licorice essence, sweetly grainy, slightly roasted caramel malt, syrupy root beer, understated sugary molasses, a touch of espresso, and duly under-appreciated earthy, musty hops. The 20-proof booze is more than capable of keeping its hedonism well under the radar.The bubbles are present, and mostly perfunctory, to no ill end, the body an adequate medium weight, and tacitly smooth, the hops and slightly metallic alcohol choosing this particular point to make their debut. It finishes a whole lot more dry than anything up to this point, the licorice character having a hard time differentiating itself from an ouzo cameo.A big, big, big, (did I say big? Ok, then) beer, of the Imperial Stout bent, fo sho. The licorice and anise (the difference is real, I know) is readily noticeable, front and center, really, with the other flavours eventually just a futile exercise of pissing in the wind, it seems by this point. Not the most complex of offerings for the style, but agreeable enough in its weight, a suitable Saturday Night Special, as ever was.Mar 02, 2013"", 'From a 1 L brown bottle. Pours out a dense opaque black hue, impermeable to light. Tall dense spongy beige head that retains well and eventually settles to a thick cap.Intense molasses and sweet black licorice on the nose, along with sweet dark malt and notes of chocolate and coffee.More intense sweetness in the flavour, almost cloying. Yeah, sweet black licorice dominates (seems more like anise to me though, perhaps some sarsaparilla root as well), with dark malt, mild chocolate, and molasses, with some dry cocoa and coffee rounding out the finish. Astringent dark malt and alcohol appear in the aftertaste.Mouthfeel is medium-full, velvety and slick texture, also dry and astringent on finish, with moderate carbonation.A real heavy hitter, and it delivers with everything mentioned on the label (hell, in the name alone!). 1 L is a bit much for anyone to tackle on their own, a friend or two to help out is well advised, or the remainder would make one hell of an expensive but kick ass marinade for ribs. Worth seeking out, however only if you enjoy licorice, as that most certainly is the powerhouse in this stout, hands down. That aside, certainly worth seeking out.Mar 01, 2013', ""Appearance - Pours a dark chocolate black with two fingers of dark and dense mocha head.Smell - Molasses, roasted malts, anise seed, licorice, cocoa.Taste - Licorice and anise seed star in the flavours, followed by the roasted malts, molasses and cocoa in the finish. Mouthfeel - Full bodied with moderate carbonation. Slight creaminess.Overall - A unique flavoured stout by adding licorice and anise seed. Since those two ingredients are notoriously strong, I was concerned about their flavours being overpowering - not the case in this brew, which balanced all the flavours well. If you want to try a stout that's a little off the beaten path, give this one a taste.Feb 17, 2013"", 'So this is my first real review, so sorry for any ""amateur"" terms or mistakes :PPoured from a 1 liter bottle into a pint glass. My pouring hand wasn\'t used to pouring this amount of beer, so it definitely quivered. I should probably work out more often. Appearance: Opaque black/brown body, with a mahogany head and some lacing, but not as much as expected. Smell: Licorice smell is the most dominant, yet I sense another lesser smell, something along the lines of a nut of some sort. I\'m assuming this could be roasted malts.Taste: Right off the bat, a very smooth licorice flavor accompanied with a roasted flavor. Neither is over powering and are very balanced. Was pleasantly surprised by this, because I feared when buying this bottle that it\'d be a liter of alcoholic licorice. Finishes with a great licorice aftertaste.Mouthfeel: The standard stout feel. I don\'t know how to describe it in any further details to be honest, other than that classic stout feel we all know.Overall: Very content about this one. My first from Howe Sound, and I was a little skeptical about their line because of the liter sized bottles at the very reasonable price of 10 dollars. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a brew off the beaten path, or just a fan of stouts in general.Jan 30, 2013', ""A: Opaque w/ chestnut edges, mocha head, decent lacing. S: A nice complexity of roasted malts and licorice. The combo is almost minty/herbal, slighty nutty, an interesting smelling stout. T: Well balanced roastiness that never seems acrid.

Pours an opaque pitch black with a nice two finger brown head with good retention and lots of lacing. Aroma is dominated by fresh black licorice with light roasted malt and a hint of cola. Flavor is fantastic, roasted malt, lots of licorice, anise seed, caraway seed, charred coffee. Finishes with light hop bitterness and lingering licorice. Medium bodied with light creaminess. High ABV well covered, making this dangerous in such a large bottle. Must resist finishing the bottle tonight... A great stout and the best use and integration of licorice in a beer that I have ever had. Outstanding.Jan 08, 2013', ""Appearance: Extreme black, tan head. Small, creamy bubbles linger on the glass.Smell: Huge roastiness. Some chocolate and coffee but definitely a lot of licorice. Very little hop aroma, given its 75 IBUs. Taste: Has a distinct flavour of salted black licorice, but without the saltiness. It's dark malt flavours are sweet and identifiable while the adjunct licorice is at the forefront. Mouthfeel: Smooth, creamy and light on the palate, given the hefty nature of this beer. Lots of malty sweetness and some decent bitterness that comes through after the sweetness subsides.Overall: Great imperial stout by Howe Sound. Added bonus of coming in a 1L swing-top bottle...Great for sharing, or for saving to drink over a couple (few?) nights.Jan 07, 2013"", 'Bottle shared by JasonJet black with some dark brown spots, thick tan head, and nice lacing along the glass. Smell is full of liquorice and anise but not so much that it dominates, still a good amount of roast and chocolate here as well as coffee, black liquorice towards the end again that leaves a bit of a fruity scent. Taste is roasty with tons of liquorice but again never seems to dominate due to the fact that there are giant roast and dark chocolate flavours here and to a lesser extent coffee, finishes bitter sweet with a liquorice aftertaste. Light carbonation, sticky medium body, almost felt like cough syrup consistency at times as well.

I've had a few bottles of this previously, going back to May (when it first started rolling out across this province), which means I've had some added time to refine my thoughts on this one.Pours bright, clear and effervescent; its golden-hued body is crowned with a layer of creamy, white, meringue-like head, which is nearly an inch thick and lasts on and on. The lacing is a bit scant, but it looks great otherwise. I'm loving the peppercorn spiciness on the nose - it's subtle, blending in sublimely well with notes of clove spice, banana ester and bready, grainy pale malts; there's also a few light, fruity suggestions along the lines of apple skin and pear. Not only is it exactly what I expect from a saison, but that black pepper also gives it some added punch.A quality brew all around; flavours of coarse grain and bready pale malt sweetness supply the backdrop, with peppercorn spiciness also being a sort of permanent (albeit faint) presence throughout the sip, peaking towards the back end. In the meantime, hints of apple, citrus peel and banana flit across the taste buds, followed up by a grassy, slightly spicy hop finish - a beautiful complement to the peppercorn and clove spice it accompanies. The aftertaste dries out quickly. Light-medium in body, with moderately low carbonation levels that weakly agitate the palate; honestly, this one could use a bit more of a bite, because it mostly feels smooth and soft - though that peppercorn spice does help fill in the void. Final Grade: 4.14, an A-. Driftwood's Farmhand Ale is a pleasing, approachable, highly thirst-quenching saison that leans toward the lighter, more 'traditional' side of this style's spectrum. Bear in mind, this saison's abv is actually pretty low compared to most modern interpretations - thus, this brew more than makes up for its slight complexity deficit with its extraordinarily high drinkability. Not a mind-blowing beer, but still high-quality stuff that I wouldn't hesitate to recommend.Sep 06, 2018"", 'Review from notes after some lawn work. 650 ml bottle was $6 CDN, glad to see more Driftwood offerings out this way.

Overall, everything is toned down from the aroma, and I find it dry on the palate, especially at the end...a really nicely balanced and flavored brew! Just as a note, as this warms up, the peppery character becomes much more noticeable and even leaves a little zing on my tongue, just like freshly ground black peppercorns would do on my food!M- This is, in my opinion medium-full bodied, and is smooth as silk on the palate! The richness of the yeast is really prominent, and the balancing act between sweet/fruit/spice/bitter is really great. At the same time, this is a really crisp finisher and keeps my palate yearning for more.D- I've never had a Saison that was brewed in Belgium but this is a world class beer in my opinion and I just know that this would rank right up with the authentic varieties!

It smells of semi-sweet wheat grain, banana chips, clove and white pepper spice, a touch of vulcanized rubber (I know!), and tame earthy yeast. The taste is quite fruity - banana, apricot, some orange pith - mostly overshadowing the more demure wheat malt, balanced all by a nice even spiciness - clove, black pepper, some funky yeast - as well as an earthy, leafy hoppiness. The carbonation is very soft, just a tingly frothiness abounding, the body a full, robust weight for a farmhouse ale, decidedly smooth, and somewhat slick. It finishes clean, and pretty dry, the grain and spice staking their final claim.Given the very autumnal weather that we've been having for the past few weeks, my harvest mentality has definitely set in (California grape shipments are imminent!).

Hints of pepper and fruit with malt. med.high carbonation and a slightly malty finish with low bitterness. As I said, a good beer in it's own right, just not comparable to saisons of belgium or even better US versions (North Coast Merle) which I think is a risk of brewing around such distinctive styles.

Note: brewed with all the usual stuff (water, barley malt, hops and yeast) and then black pepper. Hmm.Bountiful two-finger head of latte-like foam with a rush of bubbles up through a copper/sunset/amber color. Head never totally disappears and lace clings to the glass in a thick wall. Very Belgian indeed, as far as its looks go.As per style, yeast forms the basis for the aroma, bringing various herbs and spices to mind, and sure enough I'm getting black pepper. It's not overdone, and I ain't sneezing, it seems to be added in just the right amount to offer a bit of extra personality. Some mellower fruit elements creep in as well.Speaking of mellow, the flavor delivers a gentle, delicate mixture of herbal, spicy and lightly fruity characteristics. Yeast plays a part in the profile and some fresh-baked wheat bread and toffee/butter hints follow through behind it. Reminds me of Van Steenberge's Bruegel in a way, in its gentleness and subtle flavors. Fittingly, the mouthfeel is silky and soft, just right for the flavors, although it might be a tad thinner than it could've/should've been.A wonderful saison, which has become a popular style for North American brewers to tackle as of late. Thankfully it offers something more subtle and less spice-driven than its modern counterparts on this side of the world while doing its representatives from the original homeland proud -- reason enough for any Belgian and Belgian-style fan to seek it out.Jun 09, 2009"", 'A - deep orange glow, haze, white head gently floats on top, leaves some lacing behind.S - peaches, apricots, herbal spice, earthy, fresh, but not in a bright floral way, more of a wet soil right after a rain kinda thing, I dunno.

Perfect for a refreshing summer saison.Drinkability: Extremely high. They should sell this in 5L mini kegs because it's low-ish alcohol and ridiculously refreshing.

She's not very good at pouring beers (having somehow obtained a skill for slow low-carb pours), but even she gets a good three fingers of head atop a bright orange liquid. Great lace. The aroma instantly marks this beer out as a winner, with a complex mix of pear, pepper, grass and barnyard. I'd wear this as an aftershave. The initial flavour hit is a spicy pepperiness, followed up by citrus, earth and some mild barnyard funk. Moderately bitter, but hugely refreshing. The body is spot on, in my opinion... nicely crisp and ever so drying.For a new Canadian brewery to open and offer a saison in its initial slew of offerings is very encouraging. For them to completely nail the style is remarkable. I think Driftwood holds a lot of promise and I'll happily hunt down the rest of their lineup.

Not too bad though. Upon re-drinking I can gladly up the score a bit but still feel there are better saisons out there.

It brings out the richness and compliments the flavour of the beer. We mixed this flavour combination up a little bit, but I think a spoonful of that syrup is the best fit solution for this beer so far.Overall, the Angry Scotch Ale is by far a brew that makes me an antonym of Angry.

Great thickness to the head and fantastic retention/sheets of lace. Exclusively malty nose, caramel, rum, dark fruits, a bit of earth and chocolate. Taste has dark bread notes, chocolate a little more caramel and sticky toffee/tootsie. Medium mouthfeel, low carbonation. Good stuff.Aug 14, 2012', "" pint 6 oz bottle from a BC Liquor store in Whistler. Beer pours dark brown with a tiny tan head. Not much aroma, faintly malty and chalky.The first thing I notice about the beer (once it's in my mouth, that is) is that it's pretty heavily carbonated. Not much flavor, faintly roasty, faintly bitter. At least they hid the 6.5% ABV nicely, and didn't introduce any off flavors. But not impressive, sorry.Note: the label claims this is specifically a 90 shilling scotch ale (or at least inspired by one).Mar 29, 2012"", 'A: Pours with minimal head with dissipates into thin layer at the surface. Appearance is clear and colour is a deep brown with red undertones. S: Initial smell is of vanilla, butterscotch and toffee with background of oak together with dark dried fruits, such as cherries and plums, and smoky peat. There is a slight sweetness of malt in the background.T: Slight smoky peat flavour together with a nice level of bitterness on the tongue. Nicely rounded smooth finish, can detect flavours of vanilla, oak and wood with a background of highly caramelized caramel and butterscotch with hints of dark dried fruits. M: Medium bodied and nice low level of carbonation. I think it could be a bit more viscous which would improve the overall feel.O: Very easy drinking, cannot detect any alcohol. Complimented dessert very well and would go well with creamy rich cheeses.Mar 23, 2012', 'pint at Craft Beer Market 11/13/11A dark brown with only a thin film of tan head restricted by being a top filled glass so I don\'t fault the beer just the pour, lace around the top of the glass where the foam had a chance to exist S dark fruits with some sweet malt and a little chocolate I want to say molasses but the sugars not quite that dark, very nice smell not overly complex but what it has works very wellT a little cola to go with what I smell but some prune and plum tag along, a little sweet and super malty slight smoke and even with more going on I preferred the smell M enters silky and a little thin but the carbonation helps its cause and I like the nutty finish O well rounded beer and I did like the taste perhaps it was a little better then ""good"" so a slightly higher score here, I only just realized this is 6.5% from reading the description above I\'m even more sure nowI\'m hoping this on tap in Calgary is a sign of bottles to come because I would love to drink it again but it works out to 20$ a liter from a tap and that\'s little muchNov 16, 2011', ""From notes. Ample, bubbly, light tan head falls steadily but gradually. Clear mahogany with bright red highlights when backlit. Very active, and leaves some scraps of lacing. Mild roast, strongish booze that burns a little. It has an earthy character, and malty sweetness is difficult to find. Not as smoothly balanced as the taste.Mildly roasty and just a bit peaty. I can just barely detect some booze, and there is a surprisingly medium bitterness underlying it all. It's good. Well carbonated, medium body, slightly viscous, and with a biter and dry finish. Feels kind of thin.This is a good beer. The nose is a bit too boozy, and it's more bitter and less malty, with less body, than I'd like. But overall it's quite complex, tasty, and pretty well balanced.Oct 30, 2011"", 'Part of a gift from my aunt that my brother brought back on a recent trip to their place in Surrey.Poured from a 650ml. bottle, bottled June 7 2011.Appearance: A dark brown body that easily reveals reddish hues throughout. Color is lightly reflected in the head that fills half the glass before settling to 2-3 fingers. Lacing spiderwebs the whole glass around.Smell: Good peat, meaty, hint of smoke, oak and a glimmer of dark fruits.Taste: Backbone is smoke not overdone. Malt controls but there are fringes of bitterness to be felt. A bit of meat and BBQ around there. Good base but not enough depth of flavor.Mouthfeel: Medium to low carbonation. Decent feel that lacks a little as it warms.Overall: I expected (hoped) for a bit more. It was good but felt like flavor was not stepping it up.Oct 27, 2011', 'A: 3/4"" tan coloured head that dissipated quickly over cola coloured liquid.S: Sugars and malt with a hint of yeast.T: Bitter at first, malt in the middle and a pleasant sweet finish.M: Medium viscosity and a medium level of fine carbonation.O: An easy drinking Scotch Ale that leaves a pleasant aftertaste.Aug 03, 2011', 'One of the better bottles I had in B.C. Only 30 IBU yet good taste from roast and significant smoke. Though a small head on dark brown, good lacing. A decent mouthfeel. Decent drinkability, a bomber was too much for me. Carbonation is right there, and toning that aspect down would have increased smoothness and drinkability to above average for each. Some complexity. Mildly acidic in the finish.Jul 31, 2011', 'Very deep reddish brown with big tan head steadily shrinking to lasting thin foamy top, then to foamy ring and a little weak lace.Aroma is nice, rich brown bread, caramelized figs, earth, toasted bread crust, brown sugar, wood.

Settles to a chunky cap and left some thick lacing.S: Caramel malt with some earthy tones and some grassy/weedy hops.T: Actually a pretty mild taste to it. Caramel malt with some grassy hops in the background. Nothing overpowering at all. M: Medium carbonation with a medium body.O: This was more of a mild beer but it was quite enjoyable.

Aroma seems muted, may be due to my cold. Smoke and malt sweetness. Taste is surprising with no smoke, but reading the description of the beer seems appropriate. Lots of malt character, caramel, burnt sugar a bit of dried fruit... Viscous and thick. A good beer.Nov 30, 2010', '0ml bottle from Victoria. Pours a mahogany brown with hints of ruby, glass coated is miniscule bubbles - looks like Coke in my glass.An interesting beer and a fairly accurate take on a Scottish ale. Thinner body than wanted, moderate bitterness with a pleasantly dry finish, hints of sweet toffee and raisin which lose out to a more minerally and bready malt. Touches of cocoa and plums, faint smoke in the nose. Carbonation on the side of spritzy, could be toned down a touch. Drinks really easily, alcohol nowhere to be found. Pleasant beer but leaning more to the middle of the road than I expected.Nov 06, 2010', ""A: Ruby brown with a light tan head, some retention, leaves a nice lace.S: Figgy pudding, earthy-orange citrus, caramel, toffee, great stuff.T: Figs, caramel, earthy orange citrus, bready, toffee, candied fruit, nice bitterness to back up the residual sweetness. Hints of oxidation.M: Moderately full body has a light residual sweetness and modest carbonation.D: A good drinker.It doesn't have the restrained hopping and bitterness you'd get from a Scottish brewer... and I like it. It's really well-balanced, and certainly not over-the-top like some new world versions of old styles.Apparently this recently won a silver at the Canadian Brewing Awards and also a bronze at the World Beer Cup! (Well-deserved).Oct 17, 2010"", ""0ml bomber, grabbed in haste at a chi-chi downtown liquor store on a particularly hot and sunny day in Kelowna earlier this past summer. Now that the weather dictates as such, time to give this one the ol' roll in the hay, or something, ach!This beer pours a clear, very dark red brick amber hue, with two fingers of puffy and tightly foamy tan head, which leaves some jagged layers of seeping wet paint lace around the glass as it gently falls away. It smells of slightly toasted caramel/toffee malt, a bit of wet ash, ethereal dry cocoa, and weedy, grassy hops. The taste is bready, sort of grainy caramel malt, mild biscuity toffee, a suggestion of smoked peat, and dry, musty leafy, and earthy hops. The extra point and a half of ABV is not noticeable in the least. The carbonation is moderate (if a wee bit spritzy), the body a decent medium weight, smooth, somewhat unctuous, and pleasantly coating. It finishes off-dry, the lingering and still complex malt assailed by a nutty, earthy character.A very drinkable, approachable, and enjoyable (able was I...) Scotch ale, nothing particularly angry about this not so 'wee' one, lads and lasses. Worthy of warming my proverbial cockles as I await (not really) the imminent changing of the seasons, for the worse, I can assure y'all.Oct 01, 2010"", ""A - Pours a dark ruby red with a brown tinge, finger of light bubbly off-white head, decent retention, and some fine lacing.S - Dark chocolate malts dominate the flavours , some burnt wood and smoke and a bit of peat that lingers on the finishT - The peat hits you off the top, but the chocolate malts temper the flavours a bit. The last scotch ale I had was a little too peaty for my liking, but this one was rather nice. It finishes with nice espresso and caramel notes with a bit of cocoa this sits on the tongue.M - Nicely balanced carbonation, not overly dry, and quite nice on the palette.D - Tasty offering and by far the best scotch ale that I've tasted to date. Nice malt notes and not overly peaty, making for a very drinkable offering. Sessionable? Flavours are quite strong, but not too much to handle. Would totally buy this again if it were available in Alberta.Aug 13, 2010"", 'A - clear dark amber brown, short tan head retained average but laced wellS - strong caramel and toasty grain malts, slight citrus hints and clove spicinessT - strong roasted malt and sweet thick molasses, light grassy hops with earthy peat and peppery notesM - rich malt body, smooth leading to some nice bitter and slightly spicy feel, very niceD - nice balanced mix of flavours from start to finish, the flavours are strong as expected, but not a session beerAug 08, 2010', ""0ml bottle.Appearance: Deep brown amber, clear, with thick light beige head with modest retention but not much lace. The colour is definitely inviting.Aroma: Raisin, hazelnut, coffee, some hop. Something crisp about the aroma; it really cuts into the senses and wants itself to be known.Taste: Raisin, hazelnut, hint of roasted chestnuts and dark fruit, slight hop bite. Gentle cinnamon and clove as the beer warms. A very subtle hint of sweetness is well tempered by a controlled and gentle bitterness that is perfect for the style. Storm's Scottish Ale is far too sweet; this beer does not make the same mistake. This really does taste like it is brewed in the UK, perhaps like a nuttier version of Wells Bombardier.Mouthfeel: Medium to full bodied, some carbonation, chewy. Rewarding.Drinkability: This is very tasty and is further proof that Russell can produce some seriously good brews in their limited release lineup. There is almost nothing to fault here, other than a lack of lacing. But that almost feels like picking at straws.I have gone from interested in trying Russell's proper craft beers to wanting to try them every time. Impressive.Jul 20, 2010"", 'Pours a very deep dark brown color with a very thin tan head. Subdued sweet malty aroma. The taste has malt, dark chocolate, and some nuttiness. Medium-light body with a nice smooth mouthfeel. Decently drinkable, this is a nice beer from Russell Brewing.Jul 01, 2010', 'Pours a beautiful brown/red color with a brownish head that has pretty good retention and leaves some nice lacing.Smells of sweet bready malt, toffee, ripe/yeasty fruits and roasted malts.Taste is pretty much like the smell with little hop bitterness in the finish that is a bit dry. Has a hint of warming alcohol aswell. Has a medium body with low carbonation which makes it smooth.May 23, 2010', 'As the top was popped a sticky dark fruity-toffee aroma immediately filled my nostrils. I tipped the bottle over my glass and it filled with a red-brown elixir. On further inspection of the aroma I get bready malt, toasted malt and mild alcohol. In the flavour department I got toffee, caramel, bread pudding with a peaty alcohol warmth that segues in to a mildly nutty finish.May 02, 2010', ""With a new embossed bottle design the Brewmaster's Series rolls along with a new Wee Heavy Scottish Ale. It pours a lovely dark brown with highlights and a big head. The beer needs to warm up to show its complexity and malty nose. I really liked the smooth blend of malts and hops with a dryish finish that made me want more after the bottle was finished. There is plenty of malt in this beer but it is not in your face or overly sweet as some wee heavies have been. Congrats on the Russell brewers for continuing to strive for top quality beers in this series.

Mild coffee flavours with light enjoyable ginger and baking spice notes. Thinner than expected and more carbonated than I would like. Overall, one of the better Christmas oriented beers I have had this season.Jan 06, 2016', ""Gingerhead Gingerbread Stout has no head and isn't brown, but it does look stout so at least one third of the name applies. This jet black beer is dark as coffee - nay, espresso - and it's just as flat. It looks not only like it goes with dessert but could also serve as dessert in and of itself. The aroma smells like dessert alright, but gingerbread cookies aren't at the top of the menu. My first few sniffs conjured thoughts of black forest cake, hazelnut chocolate truffles and a big frothy cup of latte. Lindt should be jealous (and if I were them I'd make Central City an offer). Gingerbread is, however, foremost on the palate. Nevermind a gingerbread man - this is a whole army. Part and parcel with that is the zesty, spicy, lightly candied note of ginger as well as the toothsome taste of crystallized brown sugar and several cloves and cinnamon sticks (all in ample supply).I love all the Christmas cheer that gingerbread cookie flavour brings with it, but what makes me especially happy about Gingerhead is the fact that it favours spicy over sweet. Using an Irish Dry Stout as a base was wise; the roasted barley qualities keep the profile grounded and avoids it becoming cloying. Deck the halls with bottles of Gingerhead Gingerbread Stout! This is an easy holiday tipple to recommend. It has the festive baking seasoning as well as the hearty maltiness to suit this cold, dark time of the year. The younger me with a bigger appetite for treats would have rated it higher, but I still liked it a lot.Dec 26, 2015"", ""650 mL bottle from the LCBO; bottled Sept 25 2015. Served slightly chilled.Pours a deep-hued mahogany brown colour; very dark, for sure, but not quite opaque, as I can barely make out the bulb outline as I hold my glass up to the light. One finger of puffy, creamy-looking, light beige-tinted foam is situated atop the liquid, showing impressive retention - in fact, it continues to creep upwards for a few minutes, producing a lumpy dome that rises above the lip of the glass. Its dissipation is a long, drawn out process that exceeds 20 minutes, leaving behind plenty of delicate lacing rings. Very enticing aroma - gingerbread is, unsurprisingly, the central feature, but it blends beautifully with notes of dark chocolate, treacle, vanilla, cinnamon and spicy candied ginger root.A tasty, rich-flavoured spiced stout that is quite nicely balanced. Caramel and molasses sweetness, together with that unshakeable gingerbread flavour, give this stout a hearty, generous feel - sort of like a cake, or perhaps a (gingerbread) muffin. Nuances of chocolate and roasted malts dwell mostly in the background. Cinnamon and ginger spiciness provide an added kick on the tail end, with suggestions of coffee, chocolate and roasted malts, which effectively dry the palate. Medium-bodied, with low carbonation levels that weakly nudge the tongue; the mouthfeel is smooth and soft, thanks to the oats, but still a tad thin. Highly quaffable. Final Grade: 4.12, an A-. Gingerhead Gingerbread Stout is a seriously well-made stout that should pair perfectly with your Christmas dessert of choice. Its flaws are minor and generally forgiveable - the body's on the thin side, and the roasted malts don't come through as well as I'd hoped. The spices have been added in precisely the proper quantities - strong enough to complement and add complexity, but not so strong that they drown the other elements out. Excellent stuff; I'll be buying another bottle or two for later enjoyment.Dec 24, 2015"", ""Pours from the bomber a near-cola, pitch-black, capped by some nice head that recedes to a few millimetres, but leaves some lacing.Smells . . . like heaven. Gingerbread. Molasses. Nutmeg. Cinnamon. God, this is basically a liquid gingerbread house with a bit of a roasted, toasted malt base. A bit of coffee, a bit of chocolate.Based on the smell, the taste is a bit of a let-down. But a bit of a let down in the sense that it tastes, more or less, just like a nice Irish-style stout. Dry, roasty, malty. With only a slightly gingerbread backbone. Still, it's nice. Carbonation is perhaps a touch high, but the body is fairly balanced.Man, though--that smell. It's *gorgeous*.Dec 23, 2015"", 'Opaque black color with no visible activity. Thick creamy light brown 3 finger head, lasting around 10 minutes, legs.

Smooth light body with the perfect dose of carbonation. Medium strength finish of moderate length, ending with a ginger bread feel, really nice and well executed, perfectly spiced walnut feel. Overall excellent quality craft, pleasantly surprised, I just want to celebrate the holidays when I drink this. Delicious flavors, superbly well balanced, nothing is too excessive or heavy. Quite complex and very fresh, not very bitter, a sweet kind of stout, and still warming.

Glad to see another Central City product on our Ontario shelves as the Red Racer IPA and ISA are both excellent. Appearance - dark cola brown beer in color. Some red hues in certainly lights. A nice thick finger and change of off white head. Very good retention and some sticky lacing left behind.Smell - interesting blend. Very festive. Some milk chocolate, butterscotch and toffee with a little gingerbread, and just enough of a doughy characteristic that this actually smells like fresh gingerbread cookies. Awesome.Taste - again the beer is unique. Taste is pretty close to the nose, with the gingerbread aspects making it through here, caramel and butterscotch, a hint of powdery milk chocolate and of course some ginger. A brief sidebar of liquorice comes into play and molasses is prominent as well. Taste is good but doesn't last that long. Sweet without being too sweet.Mouthfeel - smooth with high carbonation and body is a little thinner than expected. Although with the big malt flavours that's probably a good thing.Overall - top notch holiday beer that delivers the promises of delightful gingerbread in a stout format, without being to thin or too thick.

The smell is quite appealing with the gingerbread smells and chocolate coming across quite strong. There are other Christmas spices present on the nose and some malts and caramel too. The taste is where the ginger comes through a little stronger than on the nose, but not in a bad way. Whereas there was a very nice balance between the chocolate and ginger in the smell, the ginger is stronger on the taste. Chocolate is also quite present as are other Christmas spices especially a nice finish of cinnamon. Like most of the style, this has a thin feel with a medium carbonation. A slightly bitter tail end.For a guy who doesn't usually care for ginger all that much, I liked this beer. I have to say that the way the ginger was used and balanced with other flavors really made this beer an enjoyable drink.Oct 31, 2015"", ""This pours a dark black with a thick tan head that has pretty good retention eventually thickening to a mousse like consistency. The first thing I get on the nose is chocolate, caramel, cookie dough, spices and a roasted malt. If there is ginger it is very subtle in the smell. The taste again leads with some chocolate, but more of the dark bitter kind, roasted malts, coffee and spice. The gingerbread is more prevalent on the tongue than nose. As the beer warms up the spiciness of the ginger comes forward as well. The carbonation isn't overbearing and accentuates the medium body mouthfeel as opposed to the usual full body you get from the majority of stouts. A tasty little spiced stout.Aug 25, 2015"", ""Served in the 22oz bottle. Fantastic smell when the cap was popped. Very smooth stout. Initial taste of smooth caramel and roasted oats was surprised at first because I couldn't taste much of the gingerbread. As I worked my way down the bottle the gingerbread became more and more prevalent. Over all a very sensational beer. I look forward to having another.Jun 21, 2015"", 'Labeled under the Red Betty name for the US. Produced 11/19/14.Pours an almost opaque super dark crimson-brown with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of gingerbread, ginger cookie, Christmas spice, and slight cocoa powder aromas. Taste is much the same with gingerbread, ginger cookie, Christmas spice, and roast flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roast and spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with a fantastic mix of gingerbread and Christmas spice aspects that make this one a treat to drink.Serving type: bottle.Mar 05, 2015', ""0 ml bottle poured into a mason jar mug. Very dark opaque brown with four fingers of dull tan head. Looks inviting enough. Wait until you give it a whiff. Oatmeal cookies, chocolate pudding, Irish cream liqueur, raisins, the expected pumpkin pie spices (nutmeg or mace mainly, but there's some dry ginger in there), molasses ... Incredibly rich and sweet aroma. The good news is that it tastes nearly as good. Some cinnamon stick, butter tart, dry cacao powder, chocolate-covered raisins, marzipan, ginger molasses cookies, damn near an entire bake shop. Does not scream Irish dry although there is that characteristic chalky mouthfeel. A cinnamon heart sweetness lingers for what seems like it could be days. Some of the darker roasted flavors (coffee, slight ash) do emerge as the palate acclimatizes to the spices. Full-bodied as advertized but not overly heavy. Smooth and I'm tempted to say airy. I don't typically actually TASTE oats in beer (and few individuals truly do, I suspect), although here I'm certainly leaning that way. A wintergreen hop note emerges late. This is a busy brew ... Perhaps the time is right, but I'm riding the wave and appreciating it. I often find bold spices off-putting in beer but this particular package makes it work. Smell is sweeter and more aromatic than the rather darker and more dry taste.Feb 07, 2015"", ""Nearly opaque ebony body (almost black) with a very dense, rich, creamy head; nearly solid sheets of foam curtains hanging down the glass. Very prominent aroma of ginger and cocoa. Dry ginger flavor dominates the taste but is well-balanced with a chocolate and roasted grain character. Medium body, leaning towards the light-side of of things; medium dry finish.Despite a rather weak mouthfeel, this beer is all about its adjunct ingredient of ginger. The spiciness blends well with the other grains and the aroma. It's all very heady and inviting. Very bold and intense flavors and aromas, well-balanced and complex yet very easy drinking. Perhaps its relatively light body is more of a plus than what I'm rating it as it does make this densely flavorful brew easier to drink. Still, a tad more heft to the body feel wouldn't hurt it. Regardless, this beer exudes spice and dark malt intrigue and is well worth trying.Jan 17, 2015"", ""oz bottle poured into a snifter. Branded 'Red Betty' here in America.ABlack in color with garnet hues at the perimeter. Large-bubbled tan head has decent staying power, though it settles after some time. Spotty lacing.S: Oatmeal raisin cookies, gingerbread cookies, molasses, bakers chocolate. Pure dessert on the nose. Mouth-watering. T: Gingerbread, oatmeal raisin cookies, melted chocolate chips, molasses, brown sugar. Bakers chocolate. Balancing hop bitterness, but not a lot of flavor. Hints of black coffee and roast in the background. Drying finish.M: Medium bodied. Perhaps a touch watery at its core, but the oats help a lot to give a sort of whipped airy texture. Moderate prickling carbonation.O: A great little dessert beer. It's like someone crammed oatmeal, gingerbread, and chocolate chip cookies together turducken style. Very drinkable too, it isn't a huge rib-sticking beer. My criticism is more with the bottle format- I'd much rather buy this in a six pack, and I think that format would be much more approachable to the average consumer too.Jan 11, 2015"", ""Carbonation: low; medium body.I don't rate beers on smell or apperance, but I must say that the smell from this thing is amazing. It's like the smell of liqueur-filled chocolates (none in particular since I don't know them well, but perhaps something like Bailey's), and maybe a bit of spice (still no ginger as others suggest).Bad name in my opinion. Where's the ginger? I don't understand where people are getting the ginger from... what the heck? There's strong flavors in this beer so it would be hard to find if it was mild, but I couldn't notice it at all. Even with Granville's Ginja Ninja I could at least notice a hint of ginger taste (although it is a much milder beer so would be easier to find). I did notice a bit of spice in general after a long time looking, but not ginger (nutmeg, maybe? I suppose clove as well). I suppose that it's the clove that people taste —which is the main taste in molasses cookies/gingerbread— but personally I found it hard to even notice that (despite easily noticing it as a major flavor in Unibroue's La Resolution)That said, this is a great stout, and it's certainly true to it's beer Irish dry stout category I would think. There's a very strong dry, bitter, woody taste at the end, which is really even too strong for my taste, since it somewhat hides the great flavors in the beer.Speaking of which, I enjoyed the flavors quite a bit. No ginger though. Roasted malts seemed high up there, just a little bit of coffee (I don't like much coffee so that's a pro for me), and what felt like a heck of a lot of chocolate/cocoa— especially for something that doesn't advertise it. If it wasn't for all the woody bitterness at the end, this would have been like some sort of cocoa heaven in my opinion. Am I crazy? Overall a very good beer, but the dry woodiness/bitterness is just a bit too much for me despite being a fan of stouts in general. Oh yeah, and based on my experience, I'd say don't try this for the ginger since there wasn't any (for me). Not even much gingerbread (go to Unibroue's La Resolution if you can find one)Jan 05, 2015"", 'Pours a dark black with a slightly brown head. Aroma is definitely of ginger with malt overtones.

The taste is more spiced stout, than anything overtly gingerbread in disposition, the bready caramel malt and coffee-tinged chocolate sweetness easily overpowering the various seasonal spices, even the ginger zestiness, and maybe even the late-arriving cinnamon. Ok, so not really, but you get the idea.The bubbles are rather understated, providing a pleasant frothiness, the body a sturdy medium weight, and mostly smooth, with the oats successfully creaming things all up! It finishes not as sweet as I might have been anticipating, but that just lets those spices back in the door, and 'a flooding they come - ginger, cinnamon, and cloves, for starters, um, I mean enders.An agreeable college try at recreating that most pervasive (ok, second-most - fruitcake, ech!) of love 'em or hate 'em holiday confections.

Initial sip is sweet, followed quickly with a sharp, delicious bite, followed next by a lingering citrus bitterness. A really great beer! And very probably my all-time favorite IPA-style beer.Oct 10, 2016', ""Had this cellar'd for the better part of a year, time to see how it stacks up to some of the other reviews…Appearance: Golden Orange-Amber clear but with plenty of unfiltered goodies floating about. One finger chunky and loose foam head, leaves behind a rather nice lattice of lace and only a few remnants of small foamy patches on the surface.Aromatics: nice and sweet, the hops don’t really stand forward as I thought it would. Everything seems so subtle - a little pine resin, a little toffee, a little toasted bread, a little fresh yeasty bread, a little sweet citrus… all of these little things add to a wonderfully fulfilling aroma.Taste: My first impression was looking for any indication of that 10% super sauce… and I tell ya, nary a peep! So smooth in flavour, the big bread flavours are still there and probably most prominent feature. Light toastiness in the pilsner malt, the earthiness that probably would have big green and leafy last year has matured a bit, and doesn’t have that newly green grassy quality anymore. The sugars and yeast are nearly on equal terms - having settled any differences with a glorious sweet AND hoppy profile.Feel: A solid middleweight, has some good residual carbonation that sticks it out for the long haul. Interspersed with some of the crisper pieces of bubbly is a rich and buttery fluid, somewhat oily texture, so soft and just caresses the palate. Dry and clean finish, and the bitter linger near the end is almost non-existent, the sweeter yeasty textures doing a marvelous job of smoothing that right out. Overall: To be honest I was scared when I read 187 IBU on the bottle’s scorecard. I’ve had a 100IBU before that made me wince, and here is one with 87% more! “It’s going to be way too bitter I thought?When are these brewmasters going to stop?” I settled in expecting the worse - plenty of pretzels and water at my side just in case it all went awry. But OMG, the balance of the malt while retaining this level of hop is extraordinary. It actually went down my gullet far faster than I expected and I was looking forward to that next sip. Pairing : Ambiance this baby up! Half way through this brew (once that 20 proof started to kick it up a notch) I just had to throw on “Deep Cover” I just couldn’t get through the bottle without doing the sing-a-long with the Snoop D-oh-double-g. It is an aptly crafted brew and I absolutely embraced it. Now for a food pairing - I love DaveBar’s suggestion - sushi would be a good choice, and don’t go with the plain - they have to be more North American versions like tempura prawn, tamago, beef and/or chicken - and if you can access the spicy rolls, do it! or make good use of the pickled ginger and wasabi that are usually on the side. I personally like mine with tempura dipping sauce, which I add a touch of sriracha to for some added heat. This is a fantastic savoury beer, and I think matching it up with equally robust flavourful food is the way to go.Oct 01, 2016"", ""Well, this one is not fooling around.

I'm familiar with the titular pun from the Sublime song, but apparently this is actually an ode to the first collaboration between Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg, as illustrated in the label text mentioning 'Deep Cover'.This beer pours a slightly hazy, medium copper amber colour, with three fingers of puffy, rather loosely foamy, and certainly bubbly ecru head, which leaves some broadly reaching cobwebbed lace around the glass as things slowly recede - ok, not THAT slowly.It smells of sharp pine resin (sans the dank, yay!), acrid white grapefruit, navel orange, and lemon zest, crackery, grainy caramel malt, further muted tropical fruit esters, and an edgy, kind of trash-talking alcohol measure. The taste is big bready, doughy, and grainy caramel malt, leafy pine needles, muddled, but still prominent citrus flesh (yer typical orange, Texas red grapefruit, and sugared lemon drop sort), still hard to differentiate tropical fruit, a bit of pale brown sugar, and a sidling, kind of pesky booziness.The carbonation is adequate for the task at hand, what with its junior official worthy frothiness, the body a solid middleweight, and mostly smooth, that big alcohol edging out the 'undercover' hops in the threat index here.

SMELL: Whisky, oak, caramel, milk chocolate and light coconut on the nose. Roasted notes and vanilla with sweet cream in there as well. Medium strength, but very enticing and showing potential. Lots of milk chocolate and caramel-sweet whisky. TASTE: Not nearly as good as the nose. Very disappointing. Light notes of oak and whisky notes, but quite watery and empty up front. Swallow gives mild caramel, whisky, vanilla and some milk chocolate as well. Mundane and dry finish with some bitter chocolate, sweet toffee, whisky and creamy flavors. Nothing wrong per se, just not at all impressive. Definitely well below average for the style. PALATE: Medium body and carbonation. Creamy enough on the palate, goes down fine and finishes slightly mouth-coating. No heat. Decent feel here. OVERALL: The nose was very promising and the feel was solid enough, but the flavor was quite boring, watery, mild and very uneventful overall.

Palate starts similar, initially very harsh, ashy, and roasted, but evolves toward a more refined faint sweetness over time. A thing of beauty. After the initial charcoal hit, I get burnt chocolate pudding and coffee, pumpernickle bread without the caraway seed, licorice candy, and brazil nuts. Nice malt matrix with a faint whiff of earthy hops down there in the mix. Low carbonation and dangerously smooth and creamy once the dry astringency loses steam ... These Russian imperial stouts never fail to get me at least a bit tipsy. Finish is long and lingering, with some roasted notes and light caramel apparent nearly 30 minutes after the last sip.

The taste is more gritty toasted barley malt, a fading caramel/toffee sweetness, some acrid char, unsweetened mocha, a wee black licorice note, dried dark fruit, feeble drying hops, and a well-behaved, yet still bristling booziness.The understated bubbles are pretty much just there to keep this from falling under its own heft, the body a fairly dense and challenging medium weight, and mostly smooth, some meddling hops and iceberg alcohol taking it down a peg or two.

A surprisingly suitably named brew for my 5,000th review on this site, for reasons I shall get into later.This beer pours a clear, bright medium golden yellow colour, with a teeming tower of puffy, rocky, and yet somewhat fizzy off-white head, which leaves some splotchy inkblot test lace (really!) around the glass as it quickly subsides.It smells of grainy pale malt, a pleasantly tame earthy funkiness, some lemon juice, apple skin, and very dry white wine fruitiness, faint white pepper, and a musty, leafy, and kind of herbal hoppiness. The taste is gritty, grainy pale malt, slightly cheesy and horsey funky notes, a nicely blended lemon, lime, apple, and tart green table grape fruity character, an ethereal sense of barrel-borne woodiness, and more leafy, earthy, and dead grassy hop bitters.The carbonation is adequate in its basically supportive and sometimes frolicking frothiness, the body on the light side of a typical middleweight, and generally smooth, for the style, as the bubbles seem to provide more astringency than the funk and/or hops. It finishes trending dry, that edgy white wine essence becoming more and more difficult to ignore.For a wild ale, this is very easy-going, without forgoing the things that sour-heads want to see - the funk, the fruit, and yeah, I suppose the hops. Anyways, an appropriate offering, in name, at least, for this reviewing milestone of mine - a Bodhisattva attains a certain spiritual plateau, and instead of moving on, stays behind to help others achieve the same thing.

Its crystal clear golden amber body looks like an IPA that sits on the lighter side of the spectrum.The scent of fruity pebbles strikes me first. Odell's Myrcenary comes to mind, just in the form of a lesser version. A melange of tropical goodness; mango skin, juicy peaches and grapefruit mix with a light grassy and leafy hop character. Biscuit and caramel come through as well. It has an enjoyable level of complexity relative to its ABV. The mango skins are greener and its grassiness is more pronounced. Peachy in the middle. The finish is composed of a rounded leafy bitterness and fresh biscuit. The bitterness transforms into a more raw, earthy, piney character as it lingers. Very clean and crisp from beginning to end with a refreshingly dry bitterness. Balance is key for the style and Central City nailed it with this one. This for me is neck and neck with Muskoka's Detour for my favorite ISA I've had to date. I'd have to have them side by side to decide which one I enjoy more. As a style, this isn't my favorite off-shoot of an IPA but as a beer, it hits every enjoyable quality of the style; refreshing, clean, and fruity without a strongly stated bitterness.May 24, 2015"", 'Just like the colour of its packaging, Red Racer ISA (""India Session Ale"") is substantially lighter than the standard IPA. This one is much more clear and golden instead of dense and amber. It has an overall more cheerful demeanor. Head retention, however, is similarly excellent. Lacing likewise. I\'m happy to report the hops have hardly been toned down in this \'miniature\' version of an IPA. I don\'t have the regular Red Racer on hand for comparison but I\'d wager this would fair well head-to-head, even if it doesn\'t have the same intensity. The same qualities are there, and that\'s what really counts. What qualities are those, you ask? Mostly gooey pine resin and dry, pithy citrus flavours, though floral and grass clippings, tropical fruit nectar, and caramelly maltiness are also accurate, if a little less notable answers. Despite maintaining a comparable flavour profile, bitterness is nowhere near so vigorous. Indeed, the stinging citrus and punchy alcohol often felt in the standard Red Racer IPA are nowhere to be found here. This is much less \'edgy\' and features a softer, more doughy maltiness and has an approachability that matches its strength (4%) and reasonable IBU count (40). This one has appeal, and I say that as someone who\'s generally not a fan of so-called ""India Session Ales""... Does no one else think it odd that the craft beer movement was founded on the principle of ""quality not quantity"" and microbrewers are now putting such emphasis on ales made for easy, repetitive consumption? While I\'m sure much of it is simply a logical reaction to the trend of ""extreme beers"", ask yourself, what are they really saying: that bitter, hoppy, stronger beers aren\'t easily drinkable? Sure they are! ""Sessionability"", for me, has always been less about alcohol strength and more do with flavour intensity (granted, the two are often correlated). I\'ve always found the most sessionable beers are those that offer subtle and complex flavours and aromas, the kinds that keep you engaged. I bore quickly of plain beers but characterful ones can continuously entertain me for hours.Considering Central City makes among (if not the) best IPA and Double IPA in the country, I\'m not surprised they got the ""India Session Ale"" just right. They understood that a beer can retain its bitter and hoppy characteristics and still be easily, joyfully drinkable - even for multiple servings.May 16, 2015', ""73 mL can from the LCBO; packaged Mar 13 2015 and served well-chilled. As a big fan of their regular IPA, this pickup was a total no-brainer.Pours a clear, sunny golden-amber hue, supporting one finger of loose, soapy white froth at the surface, which then proceeds to wilt away over the next couple of minutes. A decent-sized collar remains in place, along with several patches of delicate, messy lacing. There's lots of juicy, fruity Mosaic hop goodness in the bouquet, which includes citrusy notes of mandarin orange and pink grapefruit, as well as hints of peach, pineapple, canteloupe, and perhaps just a touch of cedar with wet grass.This is a very nicely-made hoppy session ale. The malt bill is extremely light, offering up only a mild bit of grainy pale malt and honeyed sweetness off in the background somewhere, while an array of tasty hop flavours bombard the tongue. Citrusy grapefruit rind, orangepeel, peach and tropical fruit are all detectable, with hints of melon and unsweetened iced tea. The profile becomes more piney/resiny as you approach the finish, with an herbal, spicy astringency fading quickly in the aftertaste. Light-bodied - but not TOO light - with appropriate carbonation levels that provide an appropriately crisp bite, with a smooth, somewhat slick mouthfeel. Final Grade: 4.34, an excellent A. A quality session IPA if there ever was one - Red Racer ISA may not be able to offer up an experience as intense or memorable as that of its big sister, but despite being lighter, it's every bit as well-made and fulfilling. It's also better than most of the Ontario-made session IPAs that I've had the opportunity to try (better price point, too). I've picked up multiple cans of this over the past few weeks and have been enjoying it immensely - so assuming it remains available locally, it's safe to say that this will become a go-to pale ale for me. Great stuff; absolutely worth a try.May 02, 2015"", 'A solid session ale! A workday IPA that shines brighter than its older sibling. Most of the hops, not all the alcohol of an IPA.

If I\'m going to drink a six or more beer, I don\'t really care about the alcohol content. Rant over. I bought this in a mixer pack because the price was right, but I would buy it again.

Really, though ... Could I ask for a better yardwork beer? A mellow golden yellow with ample creamy white head, only the first of three cans actually touched glass and largely for visual inspection purposes. Aroma is somewhat subdued and perhaps a litte tinny, but nevertheless one can detect the expected citrus, tropical fruit, and fresh-cut grass notes characteristic of this style, really just a hop flavor delivery vehicle that is not intended to convey much in the way of malt balance ... That being said, there is just a touch of nutty malt on the tongue to accompany the soda cracker scaffolding that supports a whole cornucopia of hop flavors: Tangerine, lemon (quite a lot of this actually), orange, gooseberry, raspberry jam, weakly steeped cold black tea, mint, watery lychee, and very fresh grass. Super light bodied and fizzy of course, with a squeaky clean bitter grass finish. I get what this style is trying to accomplish, and I\'m down even if things are getting rather trendy. Anticipate that skilled western craft breweries are going to keep turning out blonde ale-IPA hybrids with minimal malt and copious ""iced tea"" hop flavors: They will all be quite similar and will all be quite tasty. The particularly low ABV here is appreciated. Round 4 ...May 02, 2014', ""355ml can, part of a somewhat reasonably priced 12-pack recently made available in Alberta.This beer pours a slightly hazy, pale golden yellow hue, with three fat fingers of puffy, foamy, and generally bubbly eggshell white head, which leaves some sudsy bonsai tree lace around the glass as it slowly ebbs away.It smells of muddled citrus pith and musky pine resin, gritty pale grainy malt, and a mildly spicy grassy character. The taste is more of the same - downgraded grapefruit, orange, and lemon fruit bitters, neutered pine needle and forest floor detritus, and a thankfully sturdy crackery, bready pale malt, with just a touch of dry caramel.The bubbles are pretty tight in their bearing, but hardly off-putting, the body medium-light in weight, and not really all that smooth, the metallic bitterness of the hops clumsily traipsing about here. It finishes barely off-dry, the remaining fruity character giving itself over to the still sassy bitter pine and citrus extract essences.For its obvious downhill run from the pale ale, and especially the IPA, this one still works for what it purports to be - a lower ABV option for the hop-inclined. Don't expect the same heady experience going in here as the above-mentioned offerings from this brewery, but for the intent, this turns out just as well - hoppy, yet without the attendant alcohol. Still weird, I know, but this slim, kind of unnecessary sub-style is slowly growing on me.Apr 14, 2014"", 'I rate beers for what they and this is an excellent example of an india session ale. It\'s hoppy, crisp, refreshing and offers enough challenge to make it something even the hoppiest of hopheads can respect. due to it\'s 4% abv it is arguably more ""sessionable"" than Phillip\'s bottle rocket which I feel will be it\'s biggest ""competitor."" While I do love Phillip\'s bottle rocket I think that this suits the category a little better. It pours a light, golden amber with about a centeimeter of of white head depending on how you pour or the glass you use. Even with a well cleaned glass I did not get much lacing. The nose is fresh, light citrus, light grassy, mild pine.Taste is again, light citrus, some grapefruit with a dash of lemon, a little earthy pine to round it out. On the pallet this is crisp, on the bitter side but still soft enough to warrant downing more than one. All in all, as their Ipa is a near perfect example of what a true northwest Ipa should be, Central city\'s red racer Isa is a near perfect example of what an Isa should be. I look forward to other BC craft breweries attempts at making lighter abv beers that put emphasis on flavour. Great for new dads who like to have more than one beer but have to keep their s**t together.Apr 09, 2014', ""Red Racer ISA @4%ABV-- enjoyed from the can purchased at my local craft liquor store.A- Pours a pale yellow with lively carbonation action.

Looks like it\'s dated Aug 11 2016, if I\'m translating the stamped code correctly. This is the second bottle I\'ve cracked in the last two weeks.Pours a gorgeous, clear orange-amber colour; streams of effervescent bubbles race from the bottom of the glass to the surface, which is initially crowned with one finger of creamy, off white-tinged head. By the two minute mark it has mostly faded into oblivion, leaving behind a foamy, modest-sized collar surrounding a thin, patchy cap. Spicy notes of nutmeg, allspice and ginger snap on the nose, with pie crust and pumpkin pie filling overlapping with rich caramelized sugar from the Munich malt. Hints of vanilla and tea leafy hops.Quite well-crafted - sometimes these \'hybrid\' beers can turn out a bit muddled, but in this case, the pumpkin integrates beautifully with the underlying märzen backbone. Moderately sweet, with brown sugar and digestive biscuit flavours eventually being brushed aside by pie crust and pumpkin. The nutmeg really sticks out, with ginger and clove tying for second; the allspice and cinnamon are a bit more restrained, but still difficult to miss. The profile wraps itself up with hints of vanilla, leafy hops and earthy spice. Medium-light in body, with fairly mild carbonation that gently prickles the tongue and palate with each sip. Ridiculously drinkable for a pumpkin beer.Final Grade: 4.13, an A-. Schadenfreude is denoted a ""pumpkin oktoberfest,"" and I\'d have to say it delivers precisely what it advertises. This enticing fall seasonal pairs all of the clean, crisp, lightly sweet goodness of a märzen lager with the usual array of pumpkin pie spiciness, and the final product is an impressive fusion. I haven\'t had a boatload of beers from this BC brewer, but this one is definitely my new favourite P49 product - well worth trying if you have any interest in pumpkin beers, German-style amber lagers, or both.

In short, smells like an Oktoberfest/pumpkin beer hybrid, exactly as billed. All is right with the world.Palate strikes the same balance. Crisp and snappy for a pumpkin beer, with the spices mellow and the pumpkin pie flavor amply present but cut via grassy hops and lightly toasted grains.

It smells of bready and doughy caramel malt, a lesser generic toffee sweetness, a hint of wafting smoke, some muddled dark orchard fruitiness, and very subtle earthy, musty, and floral noble hop bitters. The taste is grainy and bready caramel malt, stewed apples and pears, besotted raisins, a touch of wet char, medium-dark chocolate wafers, iced coffee, and more plain earthy, leafy, and herbal green hoppiness. The carbonation is fairly low-key in its innocuous frothiness, the body a solid medium weight, and generally smooth, with nothing really causing any sort of trouble at this point in the game.

The taste was very much of salted caramel! I am not one for sweets of any stripe, as you know if you follow my reviews, but I do like salty & I have been known to pilfer salted caramels when they are available. They are two seemingly incongruous tastes that really work well together and they definitely do so in this beer. The site\'s Style Guide mentions a low bitterness, but I would say that it was non-existent in this one. It was sweet & salty, but that was about all. In fact, it did a great job of hiding its inherent alcohol, which could be dangerous in quantity. Finish was sweet, no getting around that, but it was pleasant, not at all cloying.

The coppered complexion straddles the boundary between clear and hazy but is very vibrant. Its head, on the other hand, is shall we say much more \'dispirited\' and can\'t even be bothered to leave lace. Despite its name, Salty Scot is far from aggressive or boisterous. In fact, it\'s surprisingly shy on personality, especially in the aroma. Clean, concentrated maltiness is first and foremost (as it should be) and, caramelly notes notwithstanding, it doesn\'t smell especially sweet (nor should it) and yet, while stylistically solid, it leaves something to be desired...But I\'m hard-pressed to think of what\'s missing. The combination of crystal, Munich and chocolate malts ensures toasty, nutty undertones in addition to that crunchy caramel flavour. Sea salt, really only noticed on the finish, nonetheless compliments the sweetness in the aftertaste (and makes for a bit of a pretzel flavour). Again, from a technical standpoint, it\'s on point. Consider that Wee Heavy is a caramelly-sweet style to begin with - you\'d expect the addition of actual caramel to put things over the top. Fortunately, you\'d be mistaken. Credit to the brewer for using enough hops to prevent things from getting cloying or syrupy (cardinal sins for any style, especially this one). They\'ve done a marvelous job at hiding the 7.5% alcohol too. Parallel 49 may take Salty Scot away in the warmer months... but they\'ll never take OUR FREEDOM!!! Sorry, had to do it. Seriously though, this is a fine winter seasonal and, despite my initial presumption, isn\'t the least bit gimmicky. It may be geared more towards the general consumer and is hence a little ""tepid"" but it\'s still a worthwhile and well-brewed recipe.Oct 20, 2016', 'Pours a rich amber/caramel color with a light tan head.

A very good appearance, quite true to style. Scents of caramel, chocolate. sweet berries, a light saltiness and hints of molasses. Overall impression of aroma is of an odd scotch ale, fruitier than many, but with caramel present as is usual. The saltiness is an interesting addition. Not as richly malty as it should be however, which is a demerit. Flavor begins malty with notes of caramel, molasses, and a noticeable berry presence and plum and dried fruit esters with an extremely light saltiness. Middle continues these flavors but adds a light bittersweet chocolate flavor. Finish is lightly dry with notes of lightly roasted malt and bittersweet chocolate coming to the fore, yet with the aforementioned flavors also still present in lower levels, and a slight touch of alcohol apparent. Aftertaste is light roasted malt, caramel, bready malt and light coffee. Overall impression of flavor is of a scotch ale, at a light level, with a bit of the advertised salt and a lot less malt than is typical for the style. Still quite nice. Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with light carbonation and a slightly thick feel with a smooth alcohol present. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a good light end scotch ale, true to form.

A deep reddish bronze or brown brew with a shocking lack of head. Upon pouring, I get a fleeting inch or so of whitish bubbles that disappear almost instantly. Scottish ales are not known for good head retention but this was nevertheless interesting. Aroma is rich and sweet, tons of toffee and dark fruit (raisin, date) and maybe a hint of citrus/piney hops (foreshadowing things to come). Palate was where this brew lost me a little. Immediate effect is burnt caramel and boozy apple/pear cider, with some vanilla and a vague salty presence coming through. The hops are leafy and resinous, making this brew rather medicinal and bitter for the style. Usually I dig Parallel 49\'s hoppy excesses but not so much here. Citric and fruity is the main sensory impression for me, although a pleasant malty smoke does build over time. Thin-bodied for a ""wee heavy"" and comes across as quite fizzy despite the absence of head. I guess all the gas lurks in the brew. Finishes wet, with a mixture of toffee, smoke, sour fruit, and pine. Final assessment is that there is some merit but I\'d pass on another opportunity. I am looking for a thicker mouthfeel and a richer sweetness with this style. This beer indeed malty but there are too many fruit and hop effects going on here that detract from the caramel flavors.Apr 05, 2014', 'Pours a reddish brown with a fluffy head and a lot of lacing.Smells sweet and malty, nutty, caramel Flavors follow the aroma pretty closely.

Taste is more sweet than aroma as sweet caramel seems to coat my tongue (the salt aspect is there I guess, but one could also describe it as a hint of toffee or bitter chocolate) and there's a smoothness to this beer as it's not light-bodied but goes down light-bodied all right.

Our currently celebrated poet is semi-famous for saying: ""prudent, cautious self-control is wisdom\'s root."". Bah - didn\'t he ever let loose on a Friday night, especially one expressly set forth in his honour? Ok, maybe not.This beer pours a hazy, dark bronze amber hue, with two fingers of puffy, somewhat foamy ecru head, which leaves some bulbous arched instances of landform lace around the glass as it evenly sinks away.It smells of sweet, caramel/toffee malt, a subtle biscuity butterscotch character, some nutty pastry notes, a soft mineral essence, which I can safely purport to be of the specifically NaCl kind, and a bit of leafy, earthy hop bitters. The taste is more sweet pastry malt - bread, caramel, brown sugar, and that sneaky, barely perceptible salt addition that we very well know about, but do little to mitigate, a further restrained saccharine nutty essence, additional butterscotch notes, and quaintly understated dry leafy noble hops.The carbonation is quietly engaging, i.e., supportive, but nowhere near overtly noticeable, the body a hefty medium weight, and generally quite smooth. It finishes well on the sweet side, the mildly biscuity, ever more so pastry-dominated malt palpably asserting itself, so much so as to put forth a dessert-friendly air, tinged just enough with subtle alcohol and leafy hops to make for a generally well-balanced affair.I was expecting a whole lot more on the salty side of things, given the name and label info, but as it turns out, this is more of warning shot across our collective bows, for the inherent and insidious pleasant/unhealthy duality is just as imperceptible here as it is in our daily grocery-drone lives. Anyway, this is still a pretty tasty, albeit sweet Scottish-style ale, moderated by the aforementioned social conventions. Nix that - I suggest drinking this for its taste, and nothing else.Jan 25, 2013', ""Thanks to 4ster for this one.Poured from a 650ml. bottle (no freshness info) and split with my wife.Appearance: A respectable head rests on top of a reddish brown body that looks very vivid.

That said, it came recommended and it was suggested it would be a good post dinner (dessert) beer which I found intriguing... As a Wee Heavy, I would say they've done a nice job with the style, and I would say they've taken a part of the Scottish Ale (slightly alcoholic/warming/sweet) and taken those characteristics and played on them by adding the sea salt which is noticeable, and turned this into a delicious dessert style beer not typical of this style. Everything is well balanced, making it not only easy drinking but making sure all the flavours stand out.

This is one of those beers that is all about the added flavour, not about the beer. What I mean is, there is pretty much zero beer flavour here.

The caramel is rich and thick, with hints of maple, brown sugar, and plum. The finish is mostly where I taste the salt, and it pairs perfectly with the caramel. I suppose what is making me rave about this beer is the intensity of the flavour.

M: Leading off with a moderate level of carbonation, slightly light in the mouthfeel and I'd prefer something a little more syrup-y, only to hold onto that malty caramel flavours longer.

Smooth vanilla, plenty of burnt (black) malt dryness, deep dark chocolate, burnt almond nuttiness, slight spice on the finish and plenty of Earthiness.....overall this reminds me fully of the Cafe au Lait that I enjoyed years ago in New Orleans flavor-wise.M/O- Velvety creamy mouthfeel and the body leans towards the full end of the spectrum.....carbonation is smooth! The higher alcohol (7.5%) is superbly well hidden and the robustness of the Stout is most definitely a masculine type of brew! Flavors lingers longingly on the palate, begging for the next sip to take place and while this does greatly on its' own, I can see this pairing well with strong cheeses as an after dinner treat!

Horchata!Mar 14, 2018"", '3ml can, an offering brought back from the commercial dead, it would seem.This beer pours a pretty solid black, with the barest of amber basal edges, and three zaftig fingers of puffy, finely foamy, and mildly bubbly brown head, which leaves some stellar tightly webbed lace around the glass as it lazily subsides.It smells of bready and doughy caramel malt, a free-range ashiness, acrid cafe-au-lait, real vanilla pods, some subtle musty spiciness, plain bittersweet cocoa powder, and some well understated earthy, weedy, and floral noble hops. The taste is semi-sweet, bready and grainy caramel malt, medium dark, vanilla-flecked chocolate, further edgy and milky coffee grounds, a still rather plain and hard to pinpoint metallic spice essence, and more wan leafy, earthy, and dead floral green hoppiness.The carbonation is fairly laid-back in its quotidian frothiness, the body a solid middleweight, and more or less smooth, with a weak airy creaminess struggling to get out of the gate here. It finishes well off-dry, the cocoa, coffee, cream, and sure, spice really working the lingering circuit.Overall - this comes across as a rather flavourful stout, with the inherent characteristics of Horchata essentially lost on this very white Canadian guy.

I buy that to a degree, based on the grain bill, although there's little in the way of obvious witbier or otherwise Belgian character here, IMO.

You get some faint hop notes, almost all of them consisting of tropical fruit. Taste is pretty damn good. Again, I saw the Nelson hops on the ingredients list and I kinda assumed this would be an over the top beer for some reason (I guess mainly because most of the Nelson IPAs I\'ve had have had that distinction), but it turned out to be the complete opposite: this beer has a really mellow tone to it: light malt body (and by light I mean you probably won\'t taste it), supporting a really mellow yet gorgeous hop profile of tropical fruits and mild citrus.Mouthfeel is similarly grand with medium to low carbonation making this beer a very easy drinker. Alcohol, to me, is completely hidden, though I\'ve seen people say it\'s noticeable, so your mileage may vary, I guess (a strange statement to make on a beer review site, I know). I personally found it to be almost too drinkable, given its alcohol content. I guess maybe that\'s my main problem with this beer (which admittedly isn\'t a very big one) - it doesn\'t have enough ""zing"" to make you feel like you\'re drinking a double IPA. If the alcohol content had been hidden, I wouldn\'t have placed this above a 6.5, maybe a 7 max. I also don\'t know if this really fits the definition of a white IPA. The wheat seems very subdued to me, although I guess it does lend the beer a slightly creamier quality.So anyway, I\'ll just come out and say this: ToH seems almost identical in taste to P49\'s earlier Snap, Crackle, Hop. I\'m not sure if it\'s just me tasting this or what, but the hop profile is really similar, as is the body of the beer (except a bit creamier, as I said earlier). It\'s obviously lacking the rice, so maybe P49 decided to brew this as an answer to all the people complaining about the use of rice in SCH. It definitely seems to follow the same standards: thin malt body, hop profile vehicle. Still, if these things didn\'t bother you about SCH, they shouldn\'t bother you here. And if you disliked the rice in SCH, you might be able to appreciate this version of the brew a bit more.edit: now that I have it again, this beer smells kinda glorious.

The taste is more mixed 'n matched fruit up front, with the pineapple blending well into yer typical domestic fruit bowl - oranges, grapefruit, and maybe some 'exotic' kiwi - alongside a so-so grainy caramel malt backbone, and further leafy, herbal, and well-perfumed hops.The carbonation is quite prevalent in its far-reaching fizzy and frothy natures, the body a decent middleweight, and generally smooth (the fruity hops exacting a minor tithe), with a subtle airy creaminess. It finishes on the sweet side, both complex fruit, and mildly stunned malt canvassing for the cause.Yes, a fresh, and engaging example of what Lower Mainland brewers seem to be into right now - big, worldly hops, the sort that evoke images of local markets in far off island paradises.

Intense sourness on the nose, kind of a Granny Smith apple tangy-ness too. It pours a very dark brown, and has a little bit of frothy head that remains long after pouring. My first two sips of this were at a temperature much too low, this had to warm up a bit for the complexity to be revealed. Once it did, the intense sourness mellowed just a bit, enough for a shy brown ale flavour to peek out. The brown ale had a bit of toffee and roasted malt notes, but these were in the very background of the sour apple tangy-ness. Now despite all I've said about how sour this beer is, in my mind the most dominant flavour of this brew is Potential :) The flavour potential for this beer is off-the-charts, especially considering how much Driftwood's previous sour beer (Flanders Red) began to balance out after even just a couple months in the cellar.

I broke it down into 3 main flavors, the first being the scotch ale flavor. It was a deep malt, sweet and thick, lots of caramel, toffee and some great peat. The second hit was the bourbon; a little booze, some honey and brown sugar, followed by a significant vanilla kick. And the third (and best) was the finish: all wine! I've never before or since tasted a beer with that smooth, oakey Cab Sauv finish! While not a traditional scotch ale style, this remains one of my all-time favorite brews.2) They're 2012 version differed greatly from their original two batches. So much so, that they even changed the label. Right after release, this beer was much closer to a traditional scotch ale than its predecessors. It lacked the complexity, the thickness and the crazy wine finish of the previous batches. Needless to say I was initially very disappointed, but once I adjusted my perspective to taste this brew for what it was, instead of what I was hoping it would be, I had to give it some credit. It had a nice malt body with a solid caramel sweetness and a soft bready finish. Some peat nuances throughout. A solid scotch ale, but nothing I would salivate over. Now here comes the BIG BUT... -&gt; BUT: after 8 months in my cellar, it is slowly returning to its previous self. The wine finish is growing, and the bourbon flavor is asserting itself. The main flavor is still the scotch ale, but the beer is starting to get more complex (finally!! haha). I'll be saving a few more bottles of this to see how far it can progress. Fingers crossed.Oct 24, 2012"", 'Thanks to wordemupg for hooking up a longtime want, 650ml into a tulip. Cheers bro!Filtered reddish orange, with a white head. Light retention. Nose is super vegetal, asparagus, cabbage and corn. a bit of peat, sweet malt and light oak. Veggies are really off-putting - yuck. Taste has more veggie, light peat, caramel, asparagus. Watery mouthfeel, sweet with a weird lingering flavour. Too many off flavours in this one for me, disappointing given the description of this beer and the expectations I had for it.Jul 08, 2012', 'Appearance.

A light tan head of big bubbles puffs up off the pour, but quickly settles to a thin cap. Sub-par head retention and lacing for sure.S - The first thing I get is actually nuttiness from this. Hazelnut and peanut are strong upfront, with a mild woodiness coming in after. I'm getting a slightly metallic twang here as well. The oak/vanilla character from the bourbon is a little underwhelming, and doesn't translate really well. Caramel malt, slight booze, and subtle leafy hops in the finish Overall, really sweet, but the red wine is almost non-existent. This is sort of reminiscent of Phillips' Trainwreck Barleywine, in that it feels like a brown ale on steroids, an imperial brown ale I suppose.T - The taste offers up a bit more punch than the aroma. Starts out smooth on the palate with caramel malt sweetness and a tasty oak presence. The nuttiness is still strongly pronounced in the profile, but has other flavors to add a degree of complexity. Finishes with a great balance of vanilla and crystal malt sweetness along side mild red wine, oak, and earthy hops to compliment the sweeter side. I wouldn't go as far as to call this a complex brew, but it certainly has depth to the profile. Still, this feels a little off the mark for the style. Overall it's a bit light for a scotch ale, lacking robust flavors of molasses, anise, or dark dried fruits. M - Really full, with a thick, hearty body and low carbonation. Alcohol is hardly perceived and overall this feels smooth and easily drinkable. D - Overall this is a good tasting beer, that offers a respectable variety of flavors. However, it still feels like it's lacking in complexity, and doesn't really feel like a scotch ale. I have to admit I'm a little disappointed in Phillips with this one, as I was really expecting home run. Oh well, still a decent beer, by an even better brewery.May 16, 2012"", 'Bottle into tulip courtesy of Rutager for the CANBIF 2012.

Nice old-timey imagery on the label of the proclaimed 'twin barrel' brewing process.This beer pours a clear, golden ruddy hue, with two fingers of thick foamy white head, which leaves some decent island arch lace around the glass as slinks away.It smells of wood, vanilla, bourbon booze, and a slight smokiness, over a subdued grainy, mildly caramelized malt. The taste is biscuity, grainy malt, more vanilla, that backwoods Appalachian corny whisky character, in moderate amounts, some late-arising meaty red wine essence, and mild earthy, leafy hops.The carbonation is a bit punchy at first, but readily settles into more tenable territory, the body a bit south of medium weight, and a tad thin, but quite smooth overall. It finishes rather off-dry, the malt and guest whisky elements still in play.Well, it seems that the whisky trumps the wine in this little experiment - JD's 'finest' besting an Okanagan cabernet sauvignon barrel (there really aren't even all that many kicking around in that particular winemaking region). At any rate, their combined, offsetting effect is a more than drinkable affair, one which still allows the biscuity underlying malt to strut its stuff.Mar 31, 2012"", 'Appearance - Pours a slightly hazy copper brown with a finger width of off-white head that dissipates quickly.

Nice bourbon notes, bring a sweet molasses, vanilla and oak flavour to the beer, while there's also a well-rounded fruitiness and wood character which I'm presuming has been heightened by the wine barrel. Smooth, creamy and delectable in the mouth. Far too drinkable!This is an impressive beer. So many barrel-aged creations almost cease to taste like beer, and end up tasting like bourbon, whiskey or whatever lived in the barrel previously. Not here! The barrel compliments the beer, but doesn't overpower it. Talking of the beer, I think the base probably wouldn't be taht great a scotch ale without the barrel addition, but its lightness works well here with the awesome addition of the bourbon, wine and wood flavours.

I've never been much of a barleywine guy, but I've got to say that I am absolutely loving this bottle of BBA Thor's Hammer. The bourbon and oak comes through with moderate force, as do the rich malt bill and high alcohol content - yet they're all working together in perfect harmony, preventing any single element from dominating the others (or causing the flavour profile to become overbearing or cloying).

Big wack of boozy bourbon and vanilla followed by raisins, plumes, brown sugar, molasses. The taste is also booze soaked with a big bourbon and vanilla presence, lots of residual malt sweetness, brown sugar, raisins, prunes and finishes with a faint bitter, metalic aftertaste.

The flavor copies the aroma; caramel and toffee notes; alcohol undertone; figs and dates; bourbon flavors appear after repeated sips. Heavy body; thick and chewy; plenty of residual sugars contributing to the mouthfeel.A pretty respectable example of an English barleywine that presents big malt-forward character and an intense yet overall balanced aspect of alcohol. Still, there is a certain lack of body depth that somewhat detracts from things and the flavors aren\'t as bold and impressive as one might expect for a big beer although a slyly developing presence of bourbon grows as the bottle dispappears. With the name ""Bourbon Barrel Aged Thor\'s Hammer"", the flavor and body aspects don\'t quite measure up yet the ABV certainly fits the bill. With that said, this is still a very approachable example of the style and should satisfy most barleywine aficionados.Feb 14, 2015', ""Full disclosure: I haven't been a fan of barrel-aged beers so far, and I didn't choose this one to drink, but instead got it as part of the Parallel 49 / Central City advent calendar.

Mouthfeel - Medium to full bodied with light to moderate carbonation.

The bourbon flavours are displayed adequately in this brew, but I was hoping that the barrel would of been more consistent in each sip (one sip getting all malts then the next getting a nice balance of both bourbon and malts/fruits).

I feel this is a very easy aged barleywine to drink, probably dangerously so. O: picked this up on a whim, had never seen it not heard of it but this is a pretty nice beer.

Saving the better stuff for last, it would seem.This beer pours a murky, dark dishwater brown colour, with one measly finger of weakly foamy, and generally bubbly beige head, which leaves a bit of melting iceberg lace around the glass as things, slowly, slowly recede.It smells of rather acerbic booze-tinged barrel notes - cheap American rye whiskey, grainy wooden staves, and a subdued caramel/vanilla sweetness - mixed 'n matched black orchard fruit, demarara sugar, sultana raisins, molasses, relatively weak bready caramel malt, a certain underdeveloped mustiness, and mild earthy, weedy, and leafy hops. The taste is again replete with more of a Jack Daniels corn whiskey astringency, one which I don't feel the need to pick apart here, over an otherwise enjoyable grainy, bready, and somewhat doughy caramel maltiness, with some soft plum and besotted raisin and cherry fruit, dark sugar syrup, understated musty yeast, and a game, but overmatched leafy, weedy hoppiness.The bubbles are quite low and out of the picture for the most part, the body a dense medium weight, and more smooth than I might have initially imagined - only the booze seems poised to take away the nice things here. It finishes on the sweet side, natch, but very much in the form of a shot of bargain whiskey, where a lot of alcohol gagging comes along as part of the deal.Hmmmmm...not all that much of a well-rendered BBA BW experience - mostly because I question the veracity of the 'Bourbon' part of the equation (look it up). Acrid, astringent, and not integrated to a point where I can sit back, sip away, and say 'right-o lads, now how about that economy of ours?'.Dec 22, 2014"", ""Got this one from Rutager a while back. Huge thanks for this one set dude! From a bomber into a snifterVintage: 2012Bottle 114 of 348Drunk along side the base beer. APPEARANCE: Pours a one finger, looser, fizzy, off-white head with lousy retention. Head quickly fades to a ring only. Mahogany red in color, clear, with no carbonation evident. A light ring remains but no real lacing. Exactly the same as the base beer. SMELL: Caramel malts with lots of fruity aromas. Dried fruits, red fruits, berries, raspberries, toffee aromas and spicy alcohol on the nose. Very much the same as the base, but with some light oak and bourbon mingling with the aroma from the base beer. Great balance, complex and quite interesting. Really nice. TASTE: All the base beer elements under a blanket of bourbon, oak and vanilla. This is a great example of a barrel aged barleywine. Some nice caramel and toffee sweetness, with dried fruits and spicy alcohol in there as well. Bourbon, oak, vanilla, and coconut from the barrel aging dance with the sweet caramel and toffee, dried fruits and brown sugars from the base barleywine. Very well balanced with a wonderfully flavorful and lingering finish. Less hot and the barrel aging has made the sweetness more manageable somehow. Excellent stuff. PALATE: Medium body and slightly higher levels of carbonation. Creamy on the palate, goes down okay with a scratch at the swallow and finishes somewhat sticky on the palate. Very little heat lingers. OVERALL: Here is an example of barrel aging really done well. The bourbon and oak flavors compliment the sweet base beer really nicely, taming the heat and managing the sweetness wonderfully. Very well balanced with a great feel for the style, this is one well worth seeking out. I hope to see this stuff again sometime, and if you get the chance, don't hesitate to give it a shot.

A very dark opaque black Irish dry stout with tan head, no discernible color halo of the sort that you often get with a porter or stout. Smells like a classic mix of baker's chocolate, cold coffee, light molasses, and dried sweet fruit (prunes?), with a pleasant whiff of smoke and faint but detectable earthy, herbal hops. Sparkly yet dry, traditional crisp mouthfeel but fortunately lacking the aggressively carbonated macro-feel of its famous cousin. Flavors are well-integrated and all the expected elements tweak the tongue: Starts chocolatey and bakery shop sweet, then there's some raisin/currant fruitiness, followed by black coffee, herbal licorice and lastly some dry lightly singed grain husks. Proficient, balanced, captures a prototypical Irish dry vibe but not dull. Fruitier than some perhaps, with more molasses and rich sweet character?

The taste is medium-sweet cocoa powder, toasted bready malt, a hint or two of dry smoke, earthy coffee beans, and maybe some understated muddled dark fruitiness.The bubbles are present, but you just know that they'll stay discreet, and they surely do, the body maintains a low-end medium weight, and is mostly smooth, a bit of that lingering char playing spoiler to a wee extent. It finishes actually well off-dry, the maltiness apparently a 'keeper', still exhibiting chocolate and dark fruit.A decent example of the style, maybe not as dry as such, but whatever, overall this is fairly tasty, easy on the mind and liver alike, and worthy of a few rounds in an ode to those who spend their days and nights on the watch.Mar 12, 2013"", ""5ml bottle poured into pint glass 16/3/12A looks pretty black until held to the light where it has some ruby cola glow to it, a nice two finger mocha head has decent retention but leaves zero laceS lots of coco powder and milk chocolate, with some faint fruit, raisin and char, bang on for the styleT a little cold coffee to go with what I smell but slightly toned down, not quite as strong as the nose but still very good M medium bodied with just enough carbonation to give it some life, flavors linger faintly of dark roastO I was pretty happy with this one, flavor and smell is great and I have no real complaints anywhere elsethanks chickenm for sending me the bottle, this one has been quite elusive almost a miracle I've never tracked it down before. this would be in my regular rotation if available around here, I could drink a few of these without getting boardMar 17, 2012"", 'Keepers stout pours a nearly opaque inky black with a nice brown head.

Not bad for a low ABV stout, but I expected some lacework here.S - Cocoa, roasted malts, a touch of coffee, a bit of smokiness - it's got that diner vibe happening. This may be more of an Irish Dry (just checked their website - it's listed as an Irish-Style Black Ale), as the hop character is almost non-existent. It's pretty understated, even when warm.T - Tastes like a pretty generic Irish Dry as well - lightly smoked and toasted malt, a touch of raisin-y dark fruit, a hint of molasses, and a dash of chocolate. It's perfectly adequate, but not super exciting, not that many Irish Dry Stouts are (unless it's Black Sun or something).

Enjoyed it last night with my dessert, a cherry & peach crisp.Poured from a 355ml. can.Appearance: As i open the can, i get a bit of gushing. Pouring it gives me a lot of mocha colored foam that briefly does a Guinness-like receding. A seriously black body that had brown tinges as i poured.Smell: Very discreet at first but certainly opened up as it warmed. Bittersweet AND milk chocolate in there, if that's possible. A slight aroma of smokiness, a subdued bitterness and a pleasant coarseness (without being harsh).Taste: At first, it was shy. Some chocolate notes with oatmeal and coffee also. A bitterness that doesn't stick around long enough. More flavor comes out though as it nears room temp. Raosted notes with more of a bitter-sweet chocolate presence. Good but somehow not great.Mouthfeel: Honestly, the body is a little thin and watery. Nothing exaggerated but enough to notice and realize that this isn't a full bodied stout. Lighter than expected but it is smooth and the carbonation is spot on.Drinkability: No troubles but it lacks something to make it truly enjoyable for me.Overall: All the ingredients seem right but it doesn't come out to a standout stout for me.

While I was pouring, it didn't look like it was going to pour much of a head so I up-ended the can and dumped the whole thing into my pint glass. A creamy three-finger, mocha-coloured head shrinks down to a thin layer and then to nothing at all. No lacing. The beer is pitch black. A decent enough looking stout. Big smell: dark, smokey roasted malt, molasses and some faint hops. Simple but nice; not every beer needs to smell like fifty different things. The flavour isn't full enough, though what's there is good. Pretty much the same qualities as the nose: smokey roasted malt and molasses. The finish is pretty nice, dry with bitter cocoa and espresso. Not bad, just too watery. Medium-light bodied which for a stout is not really a good thing. It feels like someone poured water in my stout. Medium carbonation. This beer is definitely drinkable and a step up from something like a can of Guinness, but there are just too many incredible stouts out there to be drinking mediocre stouts like this. I don't know why anyone would want to make a watery stout, it's just not my thing. All this being said, though, it's really not bad. Just not great.

Roasty and flavourful, for sure. The body is smooth, medium to light, with low carbonation. Its very drinkable and I liked it. For a while it was on the list of Canada's top 25 beers, and while I would say that its not good enough to be on that list, it certainly is a very solidly made stout.

There is a mild effluvium of citrus that floats about as well drawing all the aromas together.Taste: Complex blend of pale malts and yeast with the coriander which is more pronounced in the flavour than the nose. There is a slight graininess and the floral-ness carries through the bitter. Mouth: Carbination appears to be minimal, but has a way of snapping and popping with each sip. I'd say light side of medium body, and the hoppy bitter and spice hold hands at the finish and loiter a bit. Overall: A great example of a Belgian, I think I'll name him Mathéo.

Pairing: The flavours don't really jump out here, it is a fabulous complexity of flavours which makes pairing both easy and hard... you don't want to over do it. I'm going to say keep to simple one/two sided flavour profiles that are not specifically on taste - for example pretzels are probably too salty.

If the brewers from Russell read this, I don\'t particularly think you need to do much to your plain wheatwine. And if you do, just go subtle because it is already an amazing wheatwine as it is. Just look at the ratings that Derek and I gave the ""women and beer"" version of the fruit infused wheatwine from last year; and we are both tough people to impress.However, the plain Jane Nectar of the Gods wheatwine is so good that it wouldn\'t hurt to have it a year round release. It is the best Russell product I have tried. To come with the seasons, different additives could be infused with this wonderful beer and I\'m sure the series would be very successful.Mar 24, 2012', ""Limited (possibly one-off) bottle version of last year's cask.

The taste is slightly dull old-school yeast, more sugary pear and apple fruitiness, a ghostly sense of white cheesy funk, the standard pale and wheat malt duad, faded earthy spice, and more plain leafy and floral hoppiness. The bubbles are less than active in their lazy-ass frothiness (for the general style), the body a decent middleweight, and more or less smooth, no yeast or spice infractions here, boyo! It finishes off-dry, the varied hoppiness cutting into that still heady lingering pome fruitiness. Well, leave it to Four Winds to mess around with a base style just enough to make it seem even better to me (if probably not so to the purists, but ah, fuck 'em).

The sip then transitioned into a soft whipping of polished leather smoothed by bubblegum and stone. A muffled lemon tang lightly numbed the lips while within a candied sweetness merged with a shadowed sourness to complete the consumption. Feel: A neither prickly nor indifferent carbonation.

Firm pilsner malt undertones, a stripping yeast spice, getting a bit herbal and spiced toward the finish.

Served slightly chilled, and poured into a wine glass.Pours a cloudy golden-amber colour - very effervescent, with a virtual jetstream of bubbles whizzing their way from the bottom of the glass up to the surface. The head is brilliantly white and quite lofty at nearly two fingers high. It is also incredibly resilient - this is as appealing a saison as I've ever seen, and the aroma is similarly enticing. Hints of orange citrus and floral hops underlie more dominant notes of grainy malt sweetness, banana, and spicy Belgian yeast with a slight coriander vibe.The first sip left my eyes wide, and the next few subsequent sips then had a similar effect on my smile - this is a tasty little saison. The malt backbone is quite grainy, with a sugary, fruity sweetness reminiscent of banana and appleskin. It is the unusual combination of hops which grabs my attention, however - very grassy and herbal, with strong undertones of lemony citrus. Yeasty, spicy finish; lots of pepper, with floral notes as well. The bitterness is quite persistent into the aftertaste. Medium-bodied, with assertive carbonation initially that gradually softens as you make your way through the glass (and the beer warms); transforming from a very crisp, somewhat astringent Belgian ale into a smoother, more satisfying sipper. Final Grade: 4.06, a respectable A-. Four Winds Saison is probably the stand-out beer of this sampler pack, offering up everything I expect from this refreshing, hot-weather style - and then adding an extra, spicy kick from the yeast to make it really stand out. The use of Cascade hops seems questionable at first, but they add an enjoyable citrusy, floral dimension to the beer that blends nicely with the yeasty, fruity nature of this style.

Very few bubbles rise to the top (possibly the sign of poor carbonation) and the white head dissipates fairly quickly. A golden amber. Overall, a typical Saison color. Very little lacing. Smell - Subtle grassy notes, coriander, brown sugar, ginger, fresh cut wheat, lightly bready/ yeasty, subtle hops (barely detect Cascade, which is a good thing in my opinion -- a traditional Belgian Saison usually never uses American hops) and subtle floral notes. Taste - This may be this beer\'s strongest trait. Nothing unique or ballsy here, but a well-balanced, reasonably complex Saison. Flowers, honey, coriander, vanilla, pilsner malt, banana leaf, soft/light breadiness, orange peel, candied orange, faint butterscotch notes and wheat or grassy characteristics. Citrusy and dry. Very nice. Again, nothing new, but a really great job at balancing various elements. A surprisingly nice use of hops, and to be honest, I am a bit shocked that the ""Pacific Northwest Cascade"" hops didn\'t ruin this beer for me, which it had full potential to do. Nice bittering and the hops really pull it all together. Mouthfeel - Not bad. Nice, balanced attack on the tongue and mouth. You can feel this everywhere, but mostly on the front of the mouth. Not the greatest use of carbonation, and I feel this beer would really pop with more.Overall - This is a solid Sasion. Surprisingly, non-Americanized for a Saison brewed with West Coast/ American hops! Well disguised and balanced. My one major complaint is that it needs more active yeast, and as a result, more carbonation in the bottle. This would improve the overall activity, mouthfeel and head dilemma that I feel this suffers from. If Four Winds was to really crank the carbonation up, I would score this beer much higher. The rating I give this on taste really helped make up for the poor appearance and mouthfeel lashing I dealt it. That being said, it\'s delicious and I would buy this again, given the cost.Dec 09, 2013', 'Their ""standard"" saison available in the tasting room.

Lightly colored, a dark apple juice hue with an anemic white head. Aroma is a tad curious, juicy pears right off the bat followed by some tangerine, mango, and peach notes and a subtle brown sugar malt backbone. This was a different American IPA experience ... Certainly this brew is hopped to that degree of intensity and the smell is west coast but the flavors are decidedly those of an ""old world""/""new world"" hybrid model. Potently bitter to my palate and super fizzy to boot. The flavor spectrum traverses pine and grass, chamomile and juniper, tomato leaf and gooseberry, hints of tropical fruit and fresh cut flowers but goes right back to a gin-like herbal/medicinal bitterness, slightly sour perhaps. Subtle butterscotch and caramel lurk in the background initially but the malts do grow as you go. Like a British IPA on steroids, really. I detect some booze.

As the brew warmed up the tropical fruit scents developed, with notes of lycée, mango and pineapple. I'd suggest lingering over this drink a little to enjoy the changing scent as it warms. T: Nice smooth pine and lemon with fresh cut grass echoing the lemon grass smell. A good level of maltiness up front that balance out the hops nicely. Overall it's a smooth IPA, with a level of malts that manage to compliment the hops, without outshining them. M: Creamy, smooth and a little buttery, similar to an oaked chardonay, with enough body to leave a coating on the tongue. Fairly low carbonation - however I lingered over this for a good long time so that may be a result of the extended drinking time.

There is a good hop bitterness, touched off by malt sweetness. Bready flavours, with slight citrus hints.Everything about this ESB works. As others have pointed out, there is nothing wierd or out of the ordinary, just on overall well done beer.Apr 22, 2006"", ""This beer is back after a hiatus of a few years. The mid gold body had a nice white crown on top with a redolent hoppy nose. The taste is huge and English. This is one Vern's best offering because he takes this style to the max for flavour but maintains the ever important balance. Another great beer from one of BC's best brewers.Apr 06, 2005"", ""GI's ESB (2003) poured a crystal clear deep rusty brown colour. A thick head slowly swelled up, then reduced leaving a nice lacing and a creamy ring. The aroma is hoppy and bright. Some malty richness and caramel round it out.The flavour is beautifully balanced. Nice bold malts start out the flavour, with caramel and a bit of butteriness for kicks. As the flavour rolls around, peppery hop bitterness develops to finish it off.In the mouth, it feels nice and smooth, with a mild carbonation. Drinking it warms my tummy. This is one heck of a fine ESB. There isn't anything crazy or wild here, just an excellent example of beer done right.May 22, 2003""]",https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/780/9983/

From a bomber into a snifterAPPEARANCE: Pours a one finger, medium looking, fluffy, off-white head with very good retention. Cloudy burnt orange with no real carbonation evident. Head slowly fades to a full wisp and sticks to the sides of the glass. A splotchy wisp remains and leaves some decent lacing down the glass. SMELL: Pale malts, caramel, honeydew melon, toffee and some floral hops. Bold enough, but much the same as it's little brother. TASTE: Pale malts, caramel and toffee, with a bitter-sweet and slightly boozy finish. Medium but lingering finish of bitter, floral hops, toffee sweetness and some spicy alcohol. Tastes much like their regular IPA with some more booze. PALATE: Medium body and medium levels of carbonation. Creamier and smoother going down, finishing slightly sticky. A touch of booze lingers on the palate. Bigger with more residual sweetness, making it solid for the style. OVERALL: This is just a bigger version of the regular IPA, which I guess really isn't a surprise. Flavors are much the same with more alcohol presence. Here is an example where bigger doesn't always mean better, as the extra booze presence doesn't make it any more interesting or enjoyable. Still a good beer, though not all that special.Oct 11, 2013"", ""Had first at Toronto Beer Fest. Then this review from bottle. Poured a very cloudy hazy medium brown with an orange tint. Good head and lacing, nice retention to it.S - a bracing citrus, grapefruit, florals, cherry, very full of west coast hops, also a strong crystal malt character, some spice to it, peppery, quite full, with some resiny aspects, some caramel, toffee, biscuity with a juicy citrus.T - starts full and semisweet, lots of robust grapefruit, pine notes, orange, florals in the background, malt base is quite solid with the crystal creeping in but not too overbearing, toffee and caramel biscuit. Some piney resins, but mostly grapefruit, blood orange, then some peppery aspects to the finish. Finish has some clean juicy citrus, cherry, and a dry malt.M - full, good even carbonation, some slick hop bitterness but tempered mostly by a very malty and somewhat sweet body. Very easy to drink, juicy and just enough of a mild spice to coat and give a bit of a prickle.Overall, a very hop forward citrusy DIPA, not very alcoholic, quite citrusy and with some not insignificant crystal malt character. Together is makes a tasty, decently balanced. Tasty and hoppy, decent spice as well. Maybe not the most complex dipa, and the crystal could be toned down I think which I imagine would benefit it, but certainly flavourful and one I wouldn't mind having again.

Moderate sweetness with some pine and citrus peel notes providing the bulk of the hop flavor.Jul 30, 2012', ""50 ml bottle poured into a large snifter...A - Pours a very beautiful hazy orange body, with a nice dense beige head. Looks a lot like the real American IPA's. Good head retention and okay lacing.S - Grapefruit, oranges, a bit of bread and caramel. A slight hint of alcohol on the nose.T - This beers starts out with a very impressive and intense hop bite, with juicy grapefruit and orange notes and a moderate sweetness. Hints of caramel, butterscotch and peach. The after-taste is fairly bitter and a little bready. After the beer warms up you get more fruity notes and a hint of passion fruit. I also liked the fact that it's not very malty, so the hops get to shine.M - Medium-bodied. The carbonation is high at first, then average. Lots of hop oils, which are quite intense on the palate. Overall, this goes down very smoothly, and the faint alcohol note does not get in the way.O - Wow, this was very impressive. Despite this bottle being a few months old, it still is very hoppy and intense.

Commendable retention but negligible lacing.S: A healthy dose of pine, sweet toffee, chopped walnuts, lingering grapefruit aroma, and freshly baked & buttered bread. Emitting a certain freshness and a very earthy-like quality. Alcohol slightly detectable. T: Strong bitter pine upfront that transcends into toffee and bread-like malts. Tart and acidic qualities of grapefruit are present but not those refreshing juicy qualities of the fruit. Chopped nuts and spices are quite noticeable. Alcohol presence is a bit more than I'd prefer, however, still a deliciously bitter and creamy Imperial IPA. M: Medium-full bodied with low carbonation. Pleasingly creamy and oily with quite a chewy/resiny texture. D: A solid Imperial IPA that I'm happy to see in Ontario.

Even with a hard pour this beer only gives a 1/2 cm of head (1/4"" Yanks!) and it drops quickly leaving little lacing.S: Fairly strong piney hops, this bodes well... Definitely smell some booziness and the sweetness of malt.T: A very malty DIPA. This is sadly not to my liking... I want a tongue scraper dripping with hops, and this is not this beer. It would be best considered a ""balanced"" DIPA, a little more than an American Barleywine, but not much more. Bitterness is lacking, and builds only lightly over time. Sweet caramel and booze. Some fruitiness and pine needles, just not enough of it and certainly not enough of the fruity hops I love ...M: A little thicker than I would like, with a fish that has a sweetness that initially hides the light bitterness. I had to drink the second half of the bottle before I realized that the IBUs were building up on my tongue.O: At this point, I think I need to get some Furious and see how it tastes... I am beginning to think that my tastebuds are shot and I have hit the dreaded Lupulin threshold. I was massively looking forward to this beer, and instead I am non-plussed by it.

Taste - bit of malt in the taste, not too much though, theyre differently targeting the hophead with this beer. Maybe a little citrus in the taste but heavy pine. Mouthfeel - pretty thick and oily, really stricks the your tongue and roof of your mouth. Medium bodied. Overall - solid beer, well put together for the hop head. Awesome brewery, keep it up.

It's got a little sour citrus bite at the beginning, but then it gets into these really earthy bittering hops and a pretty robust bitter. Not a whole lot of malt either, aside from some sweetness. I'm not getting a great deal of aroma hops from this one, but maybe it's older than it ought to be. Shipping to Ontario cannot be a quick process.Mouthfeel: It's pretty much on the money here. It's slightly creamy and medium-bodied. It's got a pretty overwhelming alcohol finish which almost overrides the bitterness of the hops. The hops also leave a really piny/resin coating, which can be good but is a little off here. Overall: It's not as hoppy as I might hope from a DIPA. I expect in shipping to Ontario it's lost some of the aroma hops which might make it have the rating it has, but it just tastes and smells kinda messy to me.Mar 14, 2012"", ""Appearance: It has a nice cloudy orange/copper color to it. It has a nice off white head that dies down moderately and leaves some lacing.Smell: The aromas definitly give out hints of citrus, grapefruit, pine with bready, toasty and caramelly malts.

Nice DIPA where the extra malt doesn't overpower the hop bitterness. Earthy, citrus, nice marmalade flavor as well. Solid DIPA, I really enjoyed this.

Aromatic notes grapefruit and pine, with a hint of alcohol. Flavour-wise, this is definately a hopheads beer. It has a malty toasted bread note, but it's buried pretty far below the citrus zest and pith, and the long lingering leafy bitterness it finishes with. Alcohol is less apparent in the mouth than it is to the nose.Full-bodied with fairly low carbonation. It feels heavy and slick in the mouth, with an oily and resinous sensation left between mouthfeels.

The beer is a murky, rusty-copper hue. Nice head retention that leaves patches of lacing.S - Tons of pine resin and citrusy fruits. Big grapefruit and orange along with strong undertones of toasty caramel malt and bready biscuits with butter. Much more balance in this department than anticipated.T - Piney hop astringency and bready caramel malt dominate the palate. Finish is lingering bitterness and clearly pronounced alcohol warmth; maybe even alcohol burn. Hop character never really shines outside of the bitter finish and feel of this one. It just doesn't have a great hop profile to it. Despite the great deal of balance between the malt and hops, the overall feel is still overly astringent in comparison to the flavor. Other than the alcohol and bitterness, this almost borders on watery. By the end of the glass, the malt takes on a really strong nutty feel.M - Really thin for a big ABV, double IPA. Carbonation is kept fine, but rests on the lower side, and probably a bit flat feeling. Feels slightly astringent and quite hot and alcoholic. As it warms, the feel definitely thickens up and grows quite sticky.D - Overall, this DIPA feels too hot and bitter, without enough real hop flavor to back it up. A rather simple and unremarkable beer; I'll probably pass next time.

Clarity is fairly good, it has a bit of a haze to it but not much. the head was a bit disappointing for the style. The bone white and rocky head didn't really rise as high as I would have expected. It also feel too quickly. Some good lacing, though.SMELL (4/5) The nose is particularly good. Malt shows up a bit stronger than I have thought -- I had some apricot, like an english pale ale. The hops are not as strong on the nose, I'd say firmly present, but not dominant. They were grapefruity, which is a type I'm usually not 100% crazy about, but it worked very well here and with these malts. The yeast may have added a bit to the fruit, but the overall impression was more neutral.TASTE (3.5/5) The hops are a bit more present on the tongue. Again, the lighter fruit malt works well with the grapefruit and citrus hops. The hop bitterness is much stronger than the flavor. I like the flavor a bit more. The finish was dry, with maybe a slight carbonate flavor.FEEL (3.5/5) Body is medium and carbonation is medium-low. This makes for a velvetty feel that really distinguished this IIPA.DRINK (4/5) More drinkable that many of this style. It was not face-melting hoppy like a hop-head might want. The balance was a lot more even between hops and malts. Very nice.Jul 16, 2011"", 'Not a brand new bottle, so hop profile has probably mellowed, but a delightfully well balanced and flavourful DIPA.Beautiful dark & clear amber colour, with surprisingly little head or lacing. Decent carbonation in the mouthfeel and stylistically typical oiliness.Citrus and tropical fruits on the aroma carry nicely into the taste. Sweet caramelized malts are followed by a pleasantly bitter finish, in which the alcohol is hidden scarily well.All in all, definitely a DIPA I hope to find again.Jun 24, 2011', ""Cheers to Jan for this brew obtained in our annual beer bet/trade. Pours dark amber. Not much head. Smells a bit sweet for a DIPA. Taste is sweet with pine hops. Not super hoppy but that is not the DIPA style of our bro's up North. Mouthfeel is smooth.

Mostly citrus fruits from the hops, slick caramel from the malts, a little bit of toasted malt in the middle, a little too much malt sweetness, a touch of vanilla, pleasing bitterness, little alcohol detectable. Not bad at all.Mouthfeel: Slick, coats the tongue with a resiny, hoppy flavour like a good double IPA should.Overall: A very enjoyable double IPA.

A bit spicy and a hint of pine appeared as it warmed. Good flavour too. Bitterness was nicely balanced by bready and caramel malts up front, but lingered in the finish once the sweetness faded. Pine and grapefruit, spicy with some alcohol presence towards the end. Medium plus body with lowish, creamy carbonation, some dryness, mild warmth. Overall, a solid and well balanced DIPA.Apr 03, 2011', ""Pours a hazy, rusty amber colour with a small, but frothy white head that leaves lacing and settles as a collar.Unsurprisingly smells of hops. This beer has a rich, buttery caramel tone and a defined spiciness to the aroma. A citrus backing comes through as the beer warms.Tastes like honey-coated orange peel, with a peppery bite. The orange peel taste becomes a distinct grapefruit tone in the finish. Does a devilish job of concealing its ABV.Creamy on the tongue, but with enough carbonation to give a prickly feeling as well. The aftertaste is dry and tart, with an ever-so-slight malty sweetness that keeps your lips from puckering.I'd drink this year-round if it were always available here in Ontario.

The tongue is then attacked with lots of piney bitterness that lingers in the aftertaste.Creamy slick mouthfeel with modest carbonation.I thought that this was an interesting take on a DIPA, almost seemed like an English take on the style in a weird way. It appeared rather malt-heavy at first, but the bitterness in the back end balanced it out well. I usually prefer more hop aroma vs. straight up bitterness, but I can still appreciate this well crafted Canadian DIPA.Mar 30, 2011"", ""Thanks to northyorksammy for this one! Poured from a 22oz bomber into my Dogfish Head oversized snifter. Cloudy vermilion liquid glows a pumpkin or Portland orange when held to a strong light.

Sugary, faintly malty base suggests honey and cotton candy.Sandalwood, olive oil, evergreen, and spices on the palate. Moderate bitterness gives way to a strange maltiness and incoherent hop profile (though I'd guess there are Chinook among other C-hops in here). Hints of oak or cedar in the finish, along with a bit of soap. Some hints of aspirin. Creamy, medium-bodied, well carbonated, vaguely astringent. ABV well hidden.

Slight carbonation and impressive lacing. S- Definite grapefruit in the beginning. A little bit of floral hop notes. All of this is very evenly matched with the caramel malt. T- Bitterness in the front. Hops dominate the taste early on before the malt sets in. I think the multiple types of hops used almost takes away from this. It seems almost cluttered in the hop profile. It tastes good, but it lacks the clean hop profile some DIPAs are known to offer. I'm a bigger fan of bitterness than hop flavor so this isn't all too bad for me. The malt is somewhat subdued when cold, but seems to be a much bigger part of the experience in no time as this warms up. This seems like more of a palate wrecker than anything and reminds me of a light Devil Dancer. There's tons of hops and tons of bitterness, but I found that with all the hops and the malt it seemed to cluttered and bittersweet. If it had a bit more hops or a bit less malt I think I'd prefer it. It's still good, but a bit crowded with all the flavors. M- Creamy and only slightly carbonated. Fairly smooth. Leaves a slightly dry, sticky finish. D- Considerably drinkable. I'm usually a slow drinker, but I find that this goes down a little faster than most. I think that it's a good DIPA, and it really isn't going to disappoint anybody unless they're looking for an ultra-clean hop profile. It delivers a decent palate wrecking, and if you enjoy bitterness, this ones for you.Mar 19, 2011"", ""After a while off, I think these hops should kick my palate back into gear. Happy St. Patty's Day!What a look an unfiltered IPA has. Hazed to the nth degree, its marmalade body boasts swampy orange highlights that make visible the steady flow of carbonation that feeds the finger of creamy white head sitting on top.A pleasant smelling nose, but seems to be a bit subdued for the style. Sticky candied grapefruits are encased by piney hop resin and sweet lemons with a notable albeit subtle toasty caramel character that sits in the back. Syrupy sweet citrus glide across the tongue as a pronounced hop bitterness aggressively moves forward. A touch of caramel and breadiness comes midway through before a piney/minty hop character takes the show. I've never had an IPA/DIPA where mint is so prevalent. It seems to add a lasting quality to the bitterness while helping to dry out the palate; two classic characteristics of the style.Medium bodied with a syrupy feel. A seemingly lower than average level of carbonation but I'm not complaining. In this big DIPA, the high ABV is extremely well disguised.This marks my first beer from Tree and it has left me quite satisfied. It's a fantastic seasonal that's part of the LCBO spring release, which is made a bit more enjoyable by its Canadian origin. With a more pronounced aroma, I think this would be a highly memorable DIPA.

Its complexion has no highlighting nor a shred of transparency. The shrouds of lacing and bubbles stretch over the surface of this brownish-orange muck; funny that a beer from British Columbia be so overcast.This aroma is brought to you by the letter H, for hops. Five different varieties in fact. And each one of them has a body-odor problem. This bouquet stinks of citrus-macerated onions, citrus-basted toast, caramel infused with candied citrus, and last week\'s breakfast platter of citrus, now rank. There\'s also a contingency of pine needles not to be forgotten. I\'ll be more elaborate with the taste: lemon tarts topped with candied grapefruit, fig compote spiced with mint, custard made with brown sugar and a big splash of vanilla, pine bark dipped into gooey serum and some kind of psychedelic oranges wrapped in an herbal, bitter grass. In other words: it tastes exactly as a DIPA should taste. The ""double IPA"" style can be obnoxious to begin with. This offering is even less likely to appeal to mainstream palates because of its underlying citric, bitter acidity that is sharp as a shark\'s tooth and bites down and holds onto the palate like a bulldog. It\'s pathetic seeing the malts try to help. You need the jaws of life to pry this bitterness off the tongue! I remember thinking Kelowna was a pretty boring place to visit... that\'s when I was nine years old. If I went back today I\'m sure I\'d have NO problem enjoying myself given all the quality beers this brewery pumps out.

Caramel malts on the nose, some candi sugar... no hops.taste, is a bit of the same, however, there are some hops there on the finish. not too much, pretty much as the nose tells me, this is very malty, with little hop presence. slight bitter finish, but seems to me that they upped the alcohol and because of that they are trying to call this an IIPA... only due to the alcohol content...

Presumably a best-by date.This is textbook DIPA in appearance: Cloudy amber topped by an off white head. Laces and retains well enough, I suppose.The aroma is rich caramel malt, very toffee-like, with only very mild undertones of hops which come across more as fruity, like pineapple, than grapefruit or piney, although both are present. Round, fruited caramel malts are met by a splash of piney bitterness that is somewhat floral in the finish. There's some nuttiness here, with brown sugar and toffee, a hint of Coca-Cola washed away by a lemon rind bitterness. Well balanced with nary a trace of alcohol.Overall while I do like it it's more of a tweener for me and sits somewhere above an IPA and below a DIPA...not that there's necessarily anything wrong with that other than the name might be somewhat misleading in that I expected a tad more bitterness. And, for that matter, complexity. But looked at for what it is without any preconceptions it's quite a delicious west coast American IPA and a half.All that said, this is my sixth Hophead and they're all a little different and I have yet to pinpoint if that's because of what I have eaten or drank before, or just a genuine inconsistency in the beer in that some seem more bitter that others, and some seem to have more depth while others seem one-dimensional. Whatever the case it's a delicious beer and a welcome addition to a hop starved province.Mar 10, 2011"", ""0ml BottleAppearance - The beer pours a hazy orange colour with an above average size frothy beige coloured head.

Smell - malts, caramel, pineapple, oranges, hopsTaste & Mouth - There is an average amount of carbonation and the beer feels slightly creamy on the tongue. Most of the taste is made up of caramel mixed with hops and malts. There is also some pineapple taste and some herbal notes. The alcohol is well hidden and it finished with a malty/hoppy aftertaste and then some lingering pine flavour.Overall - A decent and drinkable DIPA but it lacks the punch that a west coast DIPA would have.

Sort of a dark rye bread element creating balance, but don't get me wrong, the aroma is tipped towards the hop end.T - Sticky, juicy, oily hops really shine here. The more oily/resinous hop character comes through as opposed to the fruity element, yet it's still quite good. Malt is there in a backup role for sure but provides decent balance to keep this from getting out of control. Bitterness lingers for a few seconds but isn't wild. Very faint alcohol lets you know what you're in for. I can understand the English IPA comparisons some other reviewers have thrown out there due to the sharp end of the bitterness and the seemingly low hopping for the style, but it still qualifies quite nice as it's so crisp and refreshing while being resinous and oily.M - Really fills the mouth and the small bubbles move it along well. Definately full bodied. The carbonation is quite a nice compliment. Not chewy at all, moving in the mouth, nice. D - Highly drinkable.

Smells of pine and citrus, with some sweetness. Some bitterness, but certainly not a palate killer. Sticky pine hops with citrus coming in a bit after. Lots of sweet butterscotch flavour for balance. Not quite a hop bomb, but a very nice double IPA still. Really nice mouthfeel and dangerously drinkable.Jun 11, 2010', ""Dated: NA From: Chris (wordemupg), 650 ml A: Dark cloudy copper body with three fingers of light mocha head. Decent retention and leaves loads of lacing. S: Big fronts of hops, pine some earthiness and sweet malts. T: Much like the smell, this is huge on the hops and balanced out nicely with malts. It seems less hoppy than it's IPA brother, but I like the malty falvouring. M: Medium-thick and medium carbonation. It's a fuller texture than it's counter part and leaves a dry bitter malt finish. I can't sense much alcohol, but my room mate could (very much so). D: Thanks again to Chris, this brew is great and has held up very well from being back in the winter. I find it balanced more than the double, but the alcohol does creep up on you. Fantastic Canadian beer.Jun 10, 2010"", ""Well, today marks my 200th review and, also, my 24th birthday. What better way to cap off a great day than with a double IPA to commemorate my double century mark of reviews! Here's to the next couple hundred . . .This DIPA pours a really attractive orange colour with a definite peachy pink hue that makes for a nice surprise right away. Into my snifter, I get a good 2 finger orange-y, rocky off-white head that kicks around for a bit and leaves a ton of sticky lacing.The aroma pouring out of this beer is chock full of northwest pine, citrus and caramel with subtle hints of bread and spice. Orange zest galore! Very promising indeed.Taste is full of caramel and, actually, a very good amount of sweet, candied dark fruit flavours that make way for the intense pine-y, citrusy hops that come in full force and follow through onto the finish and linger. With a decent hit of alcohol late-sip and a good amount of bread on the linger as well, this well balanced finish of hops and malt goes on and on and on . . . I'm even picking up some faint cotton candy flavour on the long linger as well.Mouthfeel-wise, this brew is a chewy, sticky hop nectar with a good hit of spicy carbonation and that classic oily pine finish that coats the palate, both warming it with alcohol and soothing it with a creamy texture that makes for a powerful, yet soft finish.This beer has a high ABV and is not afraid to show it! As we all know, sometimes high ABV beers can feel out of balance. However, while this beer's alcohol is blatantly present, it is worked in very well with the other strong flavours going on so as to not overpower the palette. Don't get me wrong, this is a BIG beer - it does provide quite the workout for the palette. However, I could see myself having a couple of these in one go. This is a definite must-try for all IPA-loving BA's.May 16, 2010"", ""Bottle: Pours a deep gold-orange with a puffy 1 finger cap that lasts and laces well (this is this beer's signature, if you don't see this you have a oxidized ample or a dirty glass) Aroma is a Canadianized version of the west coast APAs...chinook hop grapefruit aromas over toffee malts. Tastes pretty much as it smells; standard APA tastes but in good balance and a lighter clean finish, Glad Tree makes this or Western Canada wouldn't have a local bottled pacific NW styled APA..two thumbs up!May 02, 2010"", 'A nice dark DIPA with a small head but good lacing all the way down the glass.Tree Brewing Double IPA is a very bitter IPA with a more balanced taste. Hops, hops and more hops with a big strong alcohol backing along the alcohol taste is very much in the background. A mouthful of it taste more piney and sticky than citrus like Californian DIPAs .Definitely a great beer from Kelowna in BC but I much prefer their regular Hop Head single IPA.May 02, 2010', 'I am a big fan of Tree\'s Hop Head IPA, so when I found some bottles of the Double IPA i had to try it. Larger bottle, with a similar label. Clearly defines the product and the alcohol content. Also a bottle certificate is hung over the neck of the bottle. This certificate notes which bottle number is being consumed, nice touch. First after opening and pouring into my favorite beer glass, I took a deep smell. Immediately you are hit with a wonderfully floury smell of the hops. Mellows a little over time as the beer breathes, but is still very obvious at the end. The first taste swirled around the tongue and you notice the slightly bitter notes of the hops. Those who are not a big fan of the ""bitter beer face"" may not like what hits the tongue at the start. As you swirl it around the tongue, the flavors change. The bitter notes change to a sweet malty-ness but not overpowering. As you swallow the taste ends with a slight crispness, with only the flavor of the hops continuing on for a while. The colour is a wonderful golden amber, with a nice cream head. Bubbles are medium but do not overpower the texture of the beer in your mouth. Pairs well with spicy foods or barbecued meats. But to be perfectly honest, it is great all by itself. It has quickly become one of my favorites and the only negative is that it isn\'t a regular brew from the folks at Tree.Apr 20, 2010', ""Tree produces a delicious IPA, and their DIPA is nothing short of exceptional!A - Pours a nice creamy orange colour with a thin layer of head which slowly dissipated leaving a little bit of lacing. Extremely appealing presentation!S - The hop scent is almost sweet on the nose with strong citrus undertones.T - Wow, what flavour! Not overly bitter, which is what I was expecting based off the smell. The sweetness of the hops comes through leaving a lemon citrus after-taste. If someone asked I would've said 6%, but the 8% alcohol is nicely hidden.

The beer pours fairly dark with medium head. The hop notes are more subdued than the regular IPA from Tree but it has considerable depth after it warms up. I really loved the thick mouthfeel that anchored the hops and the malt. This is a bigger beer than the IPA and the solid finish really works with the style. I found some American Strong ale style in the beer that showed up in the way the hops worked with the bigness of the beer.

What I can pick up is grapefruit, grass, caramel malt. Smells like what I remember Hop Head to be. I didn't think to check the date, maybe this bottle wasn't too fresh. Grapefruit, citrus, caramel malt. Malty for a double IPA in somewhat typical Canadian style. Bitter, dry finish. Creamy, medium body with a light carbonation. Nice feel.

Tasty malty backbone. Unusually for an IPA, there is also a creamy, sugary, vanilla sweetness. Long bitter hop finish but sweet at the same time. 8% abv is not particularly obvious. The problem here is that this balance of flavours just doesn't balance. The sweet vanilla belongs in a porter, not in a highly hopped beer.Mouthfeel: Heavier side of medium bodied, smooth. Too creamy for the style because of the sweet aspect.Drinkability: Certainly a good hop bomb; but the sweetness here will not be to everyone's taste.

Not as much fruit made it into the flavour as it did in the aroma. Good amount of bitterness kept in check by the sweetness from the malt.Mouthfeel: On the heavier side of medium bodied, could have been bigger for a Double IPA. Average carbonation level.

It is VERY hoppy. However, it just doesn't quite measure up to the best of the US IPAs (even if it is hoppier than some). I love piney hops, but there is too much of it in the flavour, with nothing to counter balance. I have no idea what hops they used (the bottle says 5 different varieties), but I would want to re-tool the mix to get more of the sweet citrus/tropical notes to balance this baby out. The finish is very dry, again I like this direction, but it is a bit too extreme and lacks refinement. For as dark as it is, there isn't a whole lot of malt character, but it's likely being obliterated by the hops flavour.I hope like hell they continue to brew this, they are on the right track and it can only get better. I like that it is unfiltered too, wish they'd do the same with the regular Hop Head.UPDATE: I had so much trouble drinking this, I made myself up a plate of 5 stinky cheeses. About the only one that came close to standing up to this beer was the Stilton.Feb 13, 2009"", ""50ml bottle. Tree's Hophead IPA was the beer that kicked off my love affair with IPAs and all things hoppy. Now that they've made the natural forward step of producing a DIPA, I'll try to not let my bias be too obvious...This beer pours a hazy dark bronzed amber hue, with a healthy amount of thick puffy, rocky off-white head, which slowly fades away, leaving some thoroughly dense and attractive honeycomb lacing around the glass. It smells quite strongly of citrus - grapefruit and orange - a little forest pine, and a less intense sweet caramel essence. The taste is tangy citrus hops at the front, which blend into a more pine-like flavour as it moves across the palate, all deftly supported by a decent caramel/toffee malt backbone. A wee bit of warming alcohol simmers innocuously beneath.The carbonation is barely noticeable, yet a tad frothy at the same time, the body a sturdy medium weight, and as smooth as these pesky hops will allow. It finishes with a nicely bitter floral hoppiness lingering well into the aftermath. The rather elevated alcohol is well-hidden through the balance of strong, but not overbearing hops, and the silky malt. Flavour-wise, I could drink this all night - booze and retail cost considerations being a whole other matter.As this looks like, smells like, and tastes like a veritable DIPA, it stands to reason that it is indeed the Real McCoy. It appears that Tree has outdone themselves, making the appropriate amount of enhancements to their base trendsetting IPA, to produce a true West Coast DIPA, one for which they should be proud. I can only currently truly compare it to examples I've encountered south of the border, but given this, and Alley Kat/Sherbrooke's Bad Hare Day, Western Canadian brewers are on the absolute right track, at least in my titular-inspired book.Feb 07, 2009"", ""Appearance: Pours a clear, ruby-hued body with a thin, bubbly, white head.Smell: A predominately hop-scented mix of citrusy grapefruit, pine lumber, and spruce tips with a mild pale malt character tucked away in the background.Taste: Standard pale malts with a touch of grain and a faint caramel sweetness starts things off. Then it's hoppy flavors of pine, spruce, and grapefruit pith with a bold bitterness that becomes a bit caustic and particularly harsh and astringent on the back end. Finishes dry with a long, foreseeable bitterness.Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation.Drinkability: It's okay; it could be better. I'm all down for a sassy hop profile, but caustic astringency is nothing short of displeasing.Jan 30, 2009"", ""I have been dropping down serious cash and gobbling this stuff up since it's come out. I suppose it's time to lay down a review before it's all gone...Pours out a rich, deep transluscent nutty amber, tall spongy off-white head mottled with large bubbles, great retention. Thick chunky rings of lacing.The nose is a glorious blend of rich sweet bready and caramel malts, along with a well contained bouquet of citrus, tangerine, pine, peach and zesty white grapefruit rind. The flavour is also a nice little trip to paradise. Similar to their regular Hophead, but turned up to 11! Nicely balanced and contained for a double IPA, while still delivering the goods in an amplified manner. One of the most approachable and drinkable IPA's out there regardless.Gets big points in the mouthfeel for not being sticky or oily, just a little bit of oily-ness on the finish, but for the most part coats the palate with a magic carpet of goodness. Very smooth, while remaining full-bodied (or at least the high end of the medium-bodied scale....). Ummm, my combined Xmas wish and New Year's resolution is that Tree put this double Hop Head IPA into regular production, or at least produces more on a regular seasonal basis. Best thing to come out of Tree, and they should be proud. Best double IPA I've sampled out of Western Canada as well. If nothing else they should make this their regular Hop Head.Jan 06, 2009"", 'Thanks Voonder for this tasty bomber. A great hop aroma, with resins and hop oil galore. A feast for the nose, and the taste lived up to it. Understated carbonation, which worked tremendously to drinkability. The contents were shaken up and more than a bit spilled in very cold handling, but this robust trooper was most satisfying. One of the best of the style and not a taste bud killer.Jan 03, 2009', 'From a twenty-two ounce bottle - Pours a mostly clear amber with a small thin white head. Smells mostly of strong c-hops with some spice notes and caramelized malts coming through the nose. First sip is sweet then quickly bitter thanks to the massive hops. The mouthfeel is good just slightly under carbonated. A very bitter finish really smacks the lips. Could use a tab more hops as the malt back is somewhat weak.Jan 03, 2009', ""A coppery amber colour to the body. Quite clear. Two fingers of foamy beige head. Lacing as it recedes. Retention is fairly good.Full on citrus aroma, grapefruit for sure, but a sweeter hint of orange in there.A fair bit of malt right off the bat shows that there is some balance to this hop lover's brew, the tongue first gets a bready sweetness. Hops take over with a citrus blend. Orange and grapefruit again, with some lemon/lime as well. Certainly hoppy, but not as bitter as one would think.Slick, full body with a medium carbonation level, the mouthfeel is what you want for the style.I must say I expected more. I've been sucking down malty brews through the holiday and was looking forward to something that would bring home some bitterness. The hops are bang on in the aroma category, but they just don't seem to live up to it in the taste. Certainly a good beer, but fell short to my expectations. I'd have the regular Hop Head before this one.Jan 01, 2009"", ""Says it's 'unfiltered' on the bottle, but it pours a crystal clear bronze colour. There's a small but sticky light tan head that disipates quickly.Smells pretty good, lots of caramel maltiness, and distinctive floral hops with plenty of citrus and pine, and perhaps a blast of lemon there, too. There is an odd chemical type smell there too, sort of an odd sour note. Perhaps it's just a consequense of all those hops and the high ABV, but it reminds me vaguely of cleaning fluid; pine-sol, maybe. Still, it's not enough to put me off.Taste is big, bold, assertive hops. It's hard to say which is bigger - the tart blast of bitterness, or the overpowering herbal pine and citrus flavours. And there's no one hop flavour that dominates, there are a lot of different characters in balance. There are floral notes, some herbal earthiness, grapefruit, lemon, pine and fresh grassiness. All pleasant. As it finishes, the hop medley fades to leave a clean lingering bitterness, and the smooth moderately dry maltiness becomes apparent, as well as familiar fruity ale esters. I'd hazard a guess that the yeast used is an english strain, as opposed to one of the the ultra crisp American strains. Or, maybe it's just the high gravity here, but I'm not detecting quite as sharp an 'edge' as many american style IPA's. As it's warming up, I'm detecting more and more munich-style maltiness (bread crust/biscuit/hay), which I've always really enjoyed. This is a perfect 5 in taste.Body is moderately full but not thick and syrupy. Moderately low carbonation, and a full finish that would probably be downright cloying if it weren't for all those IBU's. So, I'd have to describe it as 'dry,' but not in the same crisp-dry sense as a lager, for example.It hides its 8% ABV well, and I'd say that this is actually moderately drinkeable. I could see drinking this stuff all night, though the ABV would cause me to refrain from doing so. Still, I *could,* so I say this is damn drinkeable.Dec 27, 2008"", 'Found it at Kensington Wine Market for 8-50 per 650ml bottle.Pours copper colour with thin beige head which dissapeared quickly leaving lots of lacing.

Solid brew.Dec 23, 2008', ""Appearance: Very dark amber colour with a slight head on a gentle pour. The colour is almost as dark as a brown ale.Smell: Lots of oily, sour, citrusy hops on the nose. There has obviously been quite a PNW hop influence in this beer. Less grassy than the normal Hophead.Taste: Again, very hoppy. This taste quite similar to Phillip's Amnesiac DIPA. Very nice balance between hoppy bitterness and malty sweetness. Quite reminiscent of Dogfish Head 90 Min IPA only less medicinal in aftertaste. Orange zest, grapefruit and watermelon are the dominant hop flavours.Mouthfeel: Tons of bitterness all around. Perfect carbonation leaves a little prickliness while the flavours swirl around.Drinkability: I could tell this was a heavy beer by the time the bottle was half empty(full?). The alcohol is high, but not ridiculous like other DIPA's, but I couldn't see myself drinking more than 1 bottle in a sitting.Overall: I hope Tree sees the popularity of this beer and brews it again.

Its head looks like literal lace, a decorative cotton-white draping that's thick enough to pass for upholstery cover. It definitely looks like a proper, well-made pilsner. A true pilsner is where two become one - sweetish, graham cracker-like maltiness and zesty, grassy hoppiness act here as a singular, delicious entity. Complexity is not just for imperial stouts or barleywines - just because pilsners are more familiar doesn't make them any less intricate.And this particular example also has a distinct fruitiness to go along with its more herbal side. My guess is those hints of pineapple and lemon peel relate to that little green cone that acts as the brewery's mascot. (Indeed this is made with a generous blend of Saaz, Hallertau, Hersbrucker, and Spalter.)The other side of the equation warrants attention as well. Vienna and Carapils malts result in a crunchy, chewy cereal-like graininess with a subtly sweet edge. It's perfectly attenuated and marries beautifully with the zesty florals of the hops. It's a pilsner I wouldn't bore of after one. Even in an era of barrel-aged stouts and wildly inoculated sours, I'd argue that a properly made lager is the most impressive part of a craft brewer's portfolio.

It\'s playing right into my mood on this September morning and I\'ve spent far too much time just staring at it. Intended as a kind of New World/Old World mashup, this pale ale smells like it has 50% of its mothers DNA and 50% of its fathers; the resin and fruit notes of Pacific Coast hops are definitely there but so is that telltale ""proper British upbringing"" in the form of caramelly maltiness. Indeed, the flavour leans British with a mild toffee base and earthy, somewhat weedy hops that make for an impressionable tea-like astringency. Even the water seems to share that stiff sulfate-rich profile; the finish is chockablock with minerals and, combined with spiny carbonation, has a texture like Perrier. ...that is, minus the bitterness - this sucker drinks like an IPA! At 5.2% alcohol and 38 IBU it may not have the size on paper but this has all the characteristics in the glass. The pithy, grapefruit peel quality grows as one works their way through the bomber, eventually conquering the palate. 4 Mile Pale Ale is as advertised: classic British qualities in elevated, American quantities.

The taste is bready caramel malt, bittersweet chocolate, black licorice sticks, stale dark-roast coffee, expired milk, a subtle tree branch acerbity (the birch, I suppose), brown sugar syrup, and more of the same booze-flecked earthy, grassy hops.The bubbles are pretty much tamed and kept under wraps, their frothiness a mere echo across my palate, the body a solid medium-heavy weight, and a tad tacky in its smoothness, from hop, wood, and alcohol alike.

This one displays some really decent citrus and pine notes with a well-balanced caramel malt backbone.

I gotta say, I'm pleasantly surprised.The mouthfeel is light in body with a classic oily IPA texture but has enough carbonation to make the brew finish off clean.At only 6%, this is a very drinkable IPA - it's no hop bomb, relying more on a big malt backbone but this is what makes it so easy to drink. I would certainly buy this beer again.

Clear. Suggests plenty of malt.Aroma: Grapefruit hop, malty, an unorthodox and difficult to put my finger on aromatic spice mix. Hint of grass. Interesting.Taste: The maltiness comes through strongly to start with, along with some hop. The malt flavours suggest a vague hint of chocolate, and a gentle fruitiness. The hops build as the aftertaste develops, with some grapefruit and restrained pepper, and a very gentle grassiness (which is a pleasant and unexpected surprise in a pacific northwest IPA). It develops into a woody flavour - not pine or spruce, but a wood flavour that I have not come across in beer before. Just a hint of vanilla in here and caramel in here as well, but it's very subtle and adds complexity rather than imbalance.Mouthfeel: Medium, slightly high carbonation, dry finish, moreish.Drinkability: Not the most bitter, hoppiest PNW IPA around by any means; instead, it is an intriguing and accomplished beer of malt and hop complexity that teases the palate and is likely to offer different nuances every time it is enjoyed.

Just like the much-loved Red Racer? Count me in!Poured into a goblet anyway. Golden orange-amber, fairly clear with a mild haze. Average head, little lacing. Smells enticing, grapefruit and a little pine in the nose. Unfortunately it\'s all downhill from there -- the hops are all aroma and bitterness, little in the flavour department. Where are my esters, dammit? Mouthfeel is thin and prickly, and the aftertaste is dry and bitter, slightly unpleasant. A disappointment.Aug 22, 2009', 'No longer Indian Rock IPA, just simply Cannery Brewing IPA.

Light bittering, light pine and floral notes, an earthy feel, backed by a caramel/roasted malts base. Really fairly drinkable but not a powerful IPA. Good carbonation, lacking a dry mouthfeel - more smooth and silky.Overall, not bad but not amazing. I would gladly drink this for a summer event but wouldn\'t go out of my way to pick it up.May 07, 2009', ""50ml bottle. I recall this as one of the first IPAs that I ever had, whilst vacationing in the Okanagan a few years back. Now it appears that they've changed their label - lots of disjoint images from around the world - and what's with the camels? A bit of a celebratory tipple for hitting the first big milestone on my current deployment project.This beer pours a pretty clear, medium apricot amber hue, with three fingers of densely foamy, loosely bubbly off white head, which takes a wee spell to eventually fall away, leaving some sparse, broken cloud vapor lace around the glass. It smells of mildly bitter, muted citrus and astringent pine, musty caramel malt, a touch of dry breadiness, a bit of hard water minerality, and some further herbal, leafy hops. The taste is grainy, bready, underwhelmingly caramelized malt, a bit of edgy forest floor flora, and understated citrus and pine hops, which are more straight-up bitter than actually flavourful. The carbonation is moderate, and a tad fizzy at times, the body an adequate medium weight, and even a little creamy. It finishes off-dry, the bready malt holding tough, with a lingering, and still isolated bitterness. Overall, despite an apparent ongoing theme to the contrary, this beer is definitely not too bitter, but there's something a little off in the balance of this IPA. Decent enough, overall, though, especially if you want your dry hop fix.Apr 03, 2009"", ""Pours clear copper color with gorgeous huge white head. Lots of lacing. Smell - not agressive but still hoppy, slight grapefruit aroma, earthy hops, quite nice. Taste - hoppy bitterness upfront then some citrusy aromas, finishes semi-dry. Very smooth and creamy, good IPA. It's a nice brew I'd enjoy regularly. Good beer.Feb 07, 2009"", ""The only Canunck in the 'beer club' offerings for July from Trackside Liquor store. Very fine looking IPA, slightly hazy 'ice-tea' orange with a very thick head that looked a lot liked the topping on a merangue pie. Superior rentention and lacing.Subduded aroma's for an A-IPA, sweet caramel malt almost wins the battle with the nose with the citrus/pine hop.Not bad indeed. Hop isn't the overpowering blast I was expecting. Malt and hop show decent balance with hop winning as he/she should. Good citrus/pine finish.As one reviewer stated, carbonation is so bang on you don't notice it. Only demerit would be it felt and tasted slightly watery.Decent and would make a good introductory beer to the style.Jul 10, 2008"", ""Deeply gold coloured body with an effusive white head, which settled into rocky bubbles. Crisp citrus and caramel malt aromas are well-defined and enticing. Nice grapefruit hopping balanced perfectly by caramel malts, providing a fairly textbook example of the northwest IPA flavour. The bitterness is not as heavy-handed as some IPAs. Light to medium body and carbonation. Excellent drinkability for an IPA due to its body and relatively subdued bitterness. I'd hit this one again.May 28, 2008"", 'Bottle: Poured a light copper color ale with a medium foamy head with average retention. Aroma of citrus hops is clearly detectable. Taste is a nice enough mix between citrus hops with some caramel malt. Body is a bit light and there is some metallic hops presence, which I couldn\x92t care about.Sep 25, 2006', 'Give Cannery an ""A"" for effort: this is a complex beer with a lot going on, taste-wise. However, I think it needs a little fine-tuning if it wants to be considered a great IPA.It poured from a 650 mL bomber a deep gold colour with orange highlights and a nice, thick two-finger head. I was impressed by the retention and creaminess of it, too.The smell was a comingling of citric, grapefruity hops and pine that was in danger of being overshadowed by a grainy malt profile and yeast. It could have become unpleasant, but the hops shone through just enough to save it from being off-putting.The malt takes a backseat when you start drinking and lets the hops drive this one. It starts citrusy and finishes with long, pine-y hop bite, yet manages to be pretty drinkable and not too bitter or drying. The carbonation is light, but not watery. I\'d try this beer again.Aug 31, 2006', ""A huge fluffy head retains well atop a clear light-blonde colored beer. Head turns rocky and great gobs of lace are left as the glass empties. I'll rarely give plus or minus pts. for lacing, but in this case, along with the lasting head, I have to. The lace is abundant, more than expected from this style.Smells greatly of corn, like some lagers, a little malt sweetness rears its head, as does a good jab of citrus. The bitterness in the flavor is like burnt pine or dirty citrus, not all that clean, not really that enjoyable. The malty element is a bit dull, but breaks out a little better as it warms. Overall this isn't that enjoyable, but hardly a sink-dumper either.Mouthfeel is zesty enough, if leaning toward the watery side. An unpleasant rubbery aftertaste was not welcomed in this mouth.This is like a weak pilsner masquerading as an IPA. It ain't great, but there is at least a little enjoyment to be had.Aug 21, 2006"", '0ml bottle like the rest of the Cannery beers, with a red/orange label and the words ""Fierce Hop, Gentle Bite"" on the side. Only recently available in Alberta from Penticton. Pours with a billowy cream-white with fine bubbles and intricate lacing. Slightly hazy peach iced-tea colour. The head was long-lived and sufficiently thick throughout the whole session. An excellent looking IPA. The first sniff above the glass reveals butterscotch and vanilla malting, fairly sweetish. Smelling inside the glass showcases the hopping, adding spicy tree-sap aromas and plenty of sour wet-metal smells. Some grapefruit citrus, but mostly earthy dark wood from the hops. Nice. Good balance here too, because as the beer warms the hops really do start to outweigh the malt, without killing them altogether. Nice biscuity mouthfeel with a lovely bite of dry hopping...very nice balance here in the taste. Soft citrus notes at first, and the taste is best right in the middle, where the hops edge out the malts just barely but then leave a respectable bitterness in the finish. Very grainy in the finish as well though. The hopping is really noticeable in the aftertaste as solvents and metal or even rubber. Oily and drying. The citrus becomes more pronounced the farther I go with this beer, as does the resins of the hops. The aroma actually does not let on how hop-filled the beer really is. Moderate carbonation and a medium-to-full body. Drinking this is no problem. I really can\'t find any fault in this beer for the style. Very respectable, all the elements work.May 26, 2006', ""Presented in a 650 ml brown bottle, a pleasant peachy/salmon orange label bordered by purple.Pours out a clear light coppery hue, capped by a large chunky spongy white head with good retention. Mellow aroma of citrus and floral hops, later I am able to pick out the faintest of caramel malt buried in the far background. Major hops up front in the flavour, more bitter and astringent than citric, like dandelion and arugula, with a dash of unripened white grapefruit rind. And very little else, it's all about the astringent herbally hops, the malt has no opportunity to make any sort of appearance. Pretty one-dimensional and lop-sided in my opinion, the hop bill was overdone and not refined. The mouthfeel is light and a bit watery, but with enough of a backbone to provide a smoother texture and smother most of the carbonation. Yet I am contemplating now whether I'm actually going to finish this whole glass, and if so how long it's going to take me to nurse my way down it. My mouth is coated with the aftertaste of a spring mix salad, and I'm seriously considering a chaser of my organic garlic and herb salad dressing...Apr 17, 2006"", ""Poured a crystal clear amber with a big rocky off white head. The head had some staying power and never really went away entirely.The smell is a mix of flowery and citrus hop aromas on top of a light bready malt base. Pretty good overall.Phew, it has been a while since I had a hoppy beer, and the first mouthfull kinda shocked my palate. After that things settled down. This beer starts a bit sweet with a toasty bread malt flavour. From there the hops take over and the finish is a mix of citrus and dry cracker flavour.The mouthfeel is also good for the style, it has some body to it, and the carbonation is just right. The carbonation is so bang on that at times I wasn't even aware of it, even though it was relatively lively.This is a pretty good beer, and hopheads may find it sessionable, but for me its charm wore out by the end of the 650mL bottle. Would be nice to split with a friend.Apr 13, 2006"", '50ml bottle purchased on a recent trip to Nelson. Pours a hazy bright orange with a slight, very pale pearlish-yellow head. Deep roasted hops in the nose, not the dominated typical citrus northwest feel (possibly extensive Golding use) with a pleasant and subtle \x91woodsy\x92 (think early morning dew in the forests Northern Ontario or Southwestern Manitoba) feel. Extensive toasty notes (excite the palette for what is to come). Hop bitterness is immediate, biting at the sides of the tongue but is quickly balanced by well timed arrival of some substantial malt character. Notes of grapefruit rhine and slightly buttered rye toast. The malt appears only to be dropping in to say hello, a situation reminiscent of pausing to wave hello to a good friend outside the window of a coffee shop, as you are inside deeply engaged in conversation with a date. This malt sidebar is quickly followed by the return of a substantial hop bitterness with much more Northwest characteristic; slightly tangy citrus and belligerent and tenacious lingering bitterness. Overall, one of the better balanced American Style IPA\x92s from the region: rather large hop presence but a very wonderful malt sidebar to balance. Huge drinkability for any fringe hophead, although probably not so much for your average non-IPA drinker. Quite surprising as I didn\x92t enjoy this one as much on tap, although in all fairness the night was wearing quite thin at that point. Still no Tree Hophead, but I do quite like the (although I very well could be wrong in terms of specific strain) \x93Golding-esq\x94 hop characteristic as an interesting and nearly equally satisfying counterpoint. Very satisfying for a style very much underrepresented in Alberta.Dec 18, 2005', 'Another good BC IPA, albeit one that initially does not look promising. Pours a darker orange amber, but is cloudy.

Small amount of bitters show up in the aftertaste, but they don't linger.Feel: Quickly foams up into bubbles that are a bit too large to feel creamy. Very little tongue tingle.Overall: Very gentle blend of flavors. The bitter levels are a nice complement to the strong malt and help to tamp down some of the sweetness.Jun 10, 2019"", 'Appearance: Clear with the colour of dark/burning caramelized sugar. The head reminds me a lot of the head on a cane sugar root beer - it’s towering multi-finger fluffy foam has a good range of bubble sizes the help keep the dissipation in the moderate range. Though there is a little bit of lacing that tries to purchase real estate on the glass, it eventually falls off the market completely.Aromatics: Yummy sweet nutty scent, though it is mild if first sensed while chilled. Once it warms up though you get lots of sweet and wheaty smells, like Brown Sugar Mini Wheat cereal. There are a less intense scents that border on fresh spring green leaves and milder florals.Taste: Awesome nuttiness flavour. Not too bold, but definitely hits the mark for me for a nut ale. The malted barley really bridging the gap between biscuit, sugary yeast, and the slight bitter from the hops. It is very “English” in my opinion, and a great flavour that doesn’t come off as ostentatious like others that say they are in a “traditional English” vibe.Palate: I well kept medium sized bedroom. All the mouthfeel components have purpose and match the flavour and style almost flawlessly. Carbonation is excellently maintained and allows the flavour to carry across the entire palate, the finish is clean and dry. The slight battering hop at the end is easily overlooked, because it carries the nutty flavour with it which is quite enjoyable. Overall: I loved the flavour and mouth when it was super chilled (probably 1°C) but it lacks the aromas that cold obviously. Once it warms up the flavours are a bit more pronounced, and the scents really invite you in. I wish there was a way to enjoy the flavour and smell at cold temperature because it was a great feel when chilled.Pairing : I want to spice it up, I think there may be a bit of spiciness hidden amongst the barley, a good accompaniment will have a bit more pronounced spicy kick in it. Though I would stay away from cayenne (so hot wings and sriracha oriented foods I’m not sure would work)… the spice needs to be as much compliment as it is a necessity. I’m actually thinking a warm freshly baked pull apart bread made with taco seasoned hamburger, cheese, onions, pepper blend, child powder, garlic, and perhaps a little jalapeño powder.

The last of the Cannery bombers that I've gotten to - but certainly not intended to be the least. Pleasant memories of trolling the Naramata Bench wineries are evoked through the name.This beer pours a clear, dark red-brick brownish hue, with three fingers of puffy, foamy, and generally bubbly beige head, which leaves some drooping cumulus cloud lace around the glass as it quickly recedes. It smells of semi-sweet nutty toasted biscuit and caramel malts, a bit of grainy brown sugar, bitter dark chocolate, a faint dried black fruitiness, and subtle earthy, leafy hops. The taste is more sweetened mixed nuts - pistachio, pecan and walnut seem to come to mind - a lightly toasted caramel malt, some restrained cocoa notes, and a mild herbal and earthy hoppiness.The carbonation is fairly laid-back, the body a decent medium weight, fairly round, and generally smooth, with a small touch of creaminess. It finishes well off-dry, with more sweet-tinged nutty and understated chocolate goodness.A rather enjoyable and engaging brown ale, the nuts and cocoa pretty well integrated, rendering this as an easy drinking affair, with more than a nod to potential dessert accompaniment.Dec 26, 2009"", '55ml can, also available in 650ml bottles.Appearance: Very, very dark brown. Almost black with deep red hints, transparent through the red, developing a two finger thick dark beige head when poured vigorously into 16oz glass. Head recedes to a foam and heavy ring leaving good lacing.Aroma: Prunes and raisins, possibly dark berries, roasted malts.Taste: A very malty beer with only enough hops to carry it, only subtly detectable. Prunes, raisins, modest bitter nuttiness and a hint of blackberry blend with the roasted malts in a very authentic English style nut brown ale. This is possibly the most English tasting English style beer I have come across here in the pacific northwest. Dry finish, with all flavours lingering moderately.Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, slightly thick at times. Not the smoothest or silkiest, but nothing majorly wrong here.Drinkability: Easy to enjoy a few of these. A truly authentic flavour profile that could easily fool into believing that this is brewed in England rather than in BC.

Pours a dark brown with burnt orange hilights when held up to the light, a very rich and deep color. Appearance was just what I was expecting. 2 fingers worth of light brown head of creamy foam. Good head stability thoufh it didn't quite last for the whole glass. Thin and sticky strands of lace were left on the side of my pint glass. It has some smell of roasted malts, some nuts and a touch of smokiness. No real hop or floral smells, more deep and earthy aromas. Smooth flavor with toasted grains, nuttiness, some caramel and more smoke. No real bitterness to speak of, but not overly sweet either. The body might be a little thin, but if it was too much it would coat your mouth and become oily. I thought it was very drinkable and my big bottle disappeared too soon.Apr 2011 - had another big bottle (gift from some work friends). Thoroughly enjoyed again. A very well put together Brown Ale.Aug 16, 2005"", ""Pouring from the big 650ml bottle with a great picture of the Okanagan Valley on it, Naramata boasts a great fluffy light brown head which is quite thick and sports tight creamy bubbles. It churns to a protective layer, leaving its little islands of lace, and stayed solid throughout the drink. The colour is fantastic: the beer straddles the border of rich ruby, red bordering on purple, and a rosewood brown. The appearance is much better than a large host of brown ales I have tried. The aroma is very similar to Big Rock's Dark Alberta Stout, which does not really impress me much. I get the same sourish wort or hard water smell from both these beers, and it definitely limits the beer's potential aroma. In close I get some better malty smells, dry and roasted. The dark malts DO smell fresh, but the aroma is more like a stout than a brown ale. Spices and licorice, tobacco, and tangy leather all have their part too--I just wish that lactaid sourness would go away. The taste is thankfully better: mainly a lot of dry maltiness, but it is tasty. The sourness is there in the taste too. There is not a great deal of complexity, but I get some flavours of nuts, smoked meat, seasoning salt, and leather. Very little hop profile is detectable, which did not surprise me. Maybe in the finish a dash of grassy hops exists, if you really taste contemplatively. This beer also needs just a bit more body--I was expecting richer, maltier, creamier thickness. What this beer is missing is sweetness in the malt flavour. Instead of caramel-like candy malts which I would expect from a brown, roasted dryness predominates. The sourness limits its drinkability. Verdict: this could have been much better. All the elements are there for a good brown ale, it just needs more complexity and body. I mean it is not a bad beer by any stretch of the imagination; it simply does not reach its full potential. Plus it has more in common with a dry stout(or a roasted porter for that matter) than a brown ale. I have to concede however, this beer's appearance is superb.May 11, 2005"", ""Poured from a 650 ml bottle, the B and the 2 are punched out on the side of the label regarding either bottling or freshness date, I couldn't decipher. 2 fingers of foamy beige head on the pour, the body is a deep chestnut colour, a bright mahogany when held up to the light. Mild aroma, toasted malt, some nuttiness, and a bit of a soapy character as well. The flavour is overpowered by that soapiness as well, the roasted malt and underlying chocolate flavour cannot compete with it. Still an okay brown due to that, but nothing noteworthy, and nothing I'd buy again unless they can clean up what I take to be a bottling issue. The mouthfeel suffers from this as well, the carbonation adds some body, but otherwise feels pretty watery, with a soapy texture. A disappointing first experience with a favorite style from a brewery new to me.Jul 10, 2004"", 'The Cannery Brewing Company is one of the province\'s newest microbreweries. Located in the heart of the Okanagan Valley, Cannery swung open its doors in October 2001. While the area itself has fast become world renowned for its high-class wines, the Okanagan Valley (or ""Interior"" as it is often referred to here in Vancouver) has also seen an abundant growth in the microbrewery community.The Naramata Nut Brown ale is perhaps the catchiest release (taste wise) from this newbie brewer, as they\'ve recently released this ale in an unorthodox 1000ml (1 litre) flip-top bottle. My particular bottle was hand stamped as Bottle #020746, which is a relatively high number for a micro brew in British Columbia, considering they don\x92t offer their brews in anything less than a 650ml bottle. Many other regional microbrewies have recently unveiled offerings in the sub 10,000 bottle range, so this one at 20K+, in addition to being the first time I\'ve run across it, is a fairly big endeavor.As for the beer itself, I was pleasantly surprised. The Nut Brown Ale seems to be a popular jumping off point for local breweries, who have generally pigeon holed themselves in the Pale Ale, Amber, Lager, and Cream Ale varieties. Sadly, most of the Nut Brown releases of late have had a varying degree of success. This one thankfully, would be rated amongst the better quality releases.Naramata pours a very deep amber-toned brown color with a super large head. The head is very slow to dissipate, never lowering itself below a 1/6"" sturdy surface foam. Lacing on the glass is quite hefty for this style featuring long streaming foam patches along the glass.Aroma-wise, this one presents a nice even blend of malts along with a hearty punch of roasted nuts and even a slight hint of chocolate. Little to no hop factor is present in the bouquet but that makes room for plenty of sweetness including an almost toffeeish tinge.Taste-wise, the carbonation factor is reasonable for this one, which really helps ensure that the malt combinations don\x92t overpower the brew itself rendering it as flat mess. Cannery has sufficiently addressed the flatness factor that sometimes plagues this style. This is a reasonably impressive beer from a market newbie. I anticipate future opportunities to enjoy their beer and hope that finding something on draught will be a reality at some point soon.[ STATS:&gt;&gt; SERVING: 1000 ml bottle / ABV: 5.5% / PRICE: $7.40 CAD ~ $4.87 USD ]Feb 23, 2003']",/beer/profile/4049/8688/

Sign me up, I guess.This beer pours a clear, bright medium copper amber colour, with a still teeming tower of puffy, rocky, and creamy eggshell white head, which leaves some sudsy Continental Drift lace around the glass as it eventually sinks away.It smells of bready and doughy caramel malt, muddled candy-friendly tropical fruit notes, a thankfully subtle earthy yeastiness, mild spicy esters, and some growing leafy, herbal, and piney green hop bitters. The taste is gritty and grainy caramel malt, still hard to pin down exotic fruity measures, a pleasantly understated zingy yeastiness, separate domestic citrus rind acerbities, and more testy leafy, piney and somewhat soused-up floral verdant hoppiness.The carbonation is fairly underwhelming in its quotidian frothiness, the body a decent middleweight, and sort of smooth, as that meek funky thing kind of has a certain dulling effect here.

However, Kokanee also isn\'t a bad beer - if I\'m faced with a list of macros as my choices, it will be the first I choose, without a doubt. But let\'s give it a proper tasting and see how it holds up.Pours from a brown ISB bottle into my pint glass the fairly standard macro colour. Straw golden, though a bit more noticeable than most macros, and I\'m almost convinced I\'m seeing faint streaks of copper or ruby. The brew is initially topped by a fairly healthy two fingers of white foam that dies down in a minute or two to a tiny layer - but with a some decent lacing. Very heavily carbonated, as you can tell just from the appearance of the beer. Rather anemic looking, but at least it holds a little head, unlike the major Canadian macros.Smell is what you\'d expect - a faint maltiness, with a very light sprinkling of Pacific Northwest hops that are almost lost in the background. I\'m tempted to claim this as an all-malt lager rather than a macro, but there\'s just the slightest hint of rice and corn (though it could very well be my imagine) to keep me from making that classification. Faintly grassy and fruity, which is more than you can say for most macros, and the suggestion of adjunct is distant enough that im temporarily willing to dismiss it or downplay it considering its subtlety in comparison to 99% of macros.Taste is crisp and clean. If there\'s one thing Kokanee does right, it\'s the water source - it lends itself to this crisp, clean flavour quite well (as for advocates still claiming that some Kokanee is brewed in London, this is a fairly far out claim, considering each bottle exclaims ""brewed right here in Creston, B.C."" - not even the macros could get away with false advertising to this degree). Beyond the crisp, clean taste, there\'s a subtle grassiness with hints of green apples, and a bready malt profile that I rather like. Ever so faintly metallic, but also remarkably refreshing. This is a hot summer day pounder for sure, and miles ahead of most other macros.Mouthfeel actually isn\'t bad, either. Obviously, it\'s overcarbonated, as all macro lagers are, but the body is fairly substantial, and feels quite nice sliding down your throat. I\'m willing to chalk this up to the water source, or a lack of adjunct, but I can\'t say for sure.And drinkability is tremendous. Like most macros, you can tip back quite a few of these and feel just great about it.There\'s nothing special about Kokanee, but it\'s not a bad little macro. Certainly, if Blue or Canadian had tasted this good, I wouldn\'t have really felt the need to explore and become a Beer Advocate. It\'s a simple beer with a simple flavour profile. Crisp, clean and refreshing - a great brew that you can drink in a glass or even right from the bottle and not feel to badly about it.Jun 25, 2006', 'Poured a light golden color with a light white head which dissipated quickly.

Amazingly enough, some lace actually sticks and is still present when the glass is empty.The nose consists of untoasted husky grain with the suggestion of sweetness and a little shot of lemon zest. Thankfully, there are no artificial, skunky or off odors. If a macro lager's nose doesn't offend, it's ahead of the game as far as I'm concerned.The downward slide continues. On the positive side of the ledger, the flavor is mild and the body is light and airy. On the negative side, the beer is just short of unpalatable. It's artificially sweet and tastes like stale grain with a bitterness that bears no resemblance to hops. The lemoniness is gone and in its place is... nothing. The body/mouthfeel is thin and watery, for which I'm grateful. If the flavor was cranked up a few notches and had more palate permanence, this lager would border on undrinkable. A word to the wise: don't drink it once it warms or, I promise you, you'll be sorry.Kokanee Glacier Beer isn't a particularly good example of a style that I have a hard time tolerating.

But, their is a decent malt presence. Barley malt, not corn. Sure, if corn was used in this, I wouldn't be surprised. But it is not the primary ingredient. Some grassy smell as well. Small amount of hops, or small amount of hop extract. Nothing to really complain about, but nothing to praise neither. Tastes, well, fine. Not good, but fine. Better than the typical macro. Light, sweet malts, some grassy flavour, bit of a bitter aftertaste. Reminds me of most peoples first homebrew. Basic, but decent. Mouthfeel is a tad thin, but crisp like a dried autumn leaf.

I don't know what it means, but it's still a good beer, especially for an adjunct lager. Also, Kokanee claims to be micro-brewed by Columbia Breweries in Creston,BC. Actually, Columbia is owned by Labatt (now a Interbrew branch) and it is not really a micro since it is available almost everywhere in Canada. There's rumors here about being brewing in both Creston (western markets) and London,ON (eastern markets). Marketing and label insist on its BC rockies origines, but rumors also exist about a difference of taste between the western and eastern product. The quality of Thames river in London seems to be the reason of that different taste. However, Kokanee smells good, has a nice gold color and has a good personnality, but it's quite overpriced if compared to others regular domestic adjunct lagers available here.Dec 11, 2004"", 'Pours clear gold, short head that disipates quickly, leaves some thin sticky lace.

It is an unasuming lager that is best utilized whilst sitting in front of the TV or relaxing after having come home from work on a hot day. No need to pour it into a glass, as it will not impress. What WILL impress you is that you can buy twelve of these at just above fratboy-prices (Read: Keystone) at the supermarket - a bargain in that it tastes so much better than most American macro-pilseners.

The taste is bready and grainy pale malt, some weak coriander and black peppercorn spice, ethereal domestic citrus rind, a hint of overripe banana, slightly phenolic yeast, and more well understated earthy, weedy, and floral verdant hoppiness.The carbonation is rather involved in its somewhat aggressive frothiness, the body a so-so medium weight, and more or less smooth, with a wee airy creaminess arising as things move out of yer typical basement bar fridge temperature zone. It finishes off-dry, the still mixed malt ruling the lingering day.Overall, this is one of the plainer offerings that this Belgian-oriented Lotusland brewery has yet to come out with - there's nothing wrong with it, however the spice, fruit, and even yeast, just seem so, well, muffled. At any rate, not hard to put back, by any means, but kind of forgettable by the same token.Apr 23, 2017""]",/beer/profile/35134/278087/

The taste is semi-sweet blueberry puree, more indistinct citrus pith, grainy and bready caramel malt, a plain earthy yeastiness, ethereal milky notes, and some understated leafy, weedy, and floral noble hoppiness.The carbonation is fairly inert in its run of the mill frothiness, the body a decent middleweight, and generally smooth, the gently lactic blueberry character very benevolent in its ongoing proceedings. It finishes off-dry, that initial blueberry confection essence still a strong lingering presence.Overall - while I don't typically cotton to this particular fruit in the real world (I had to answer my son's query at lunchtime about why I wouldn't have some of his frozen blueberries for the umpteenth time earlier today), I somehow don't have a problem with it in beer - just like coffee, huh. Anyways, here they are resplendent, and do well to engender a hearty quaffability, even if the sour part of the equation is thankfully lost on me.Dec 02, 2017"", 'Appearance: Pours a hazy bluish pink (almost like ruby red grapefruit with a splash of blueberry juice) and a fairly frothy pale pink-white head that dissipates almost as quickly as it forms. a spatter of tiny surface bubbles linger as well a small collection around the ring.Aromatics: Ahhhh BLUEBERRIES! There is no hiding the blueberry scent in this baby, my first whiff really reminded me of a blue Mr. Freeze (i.e. blue freezy). The nose so full of sweet and tangy fruit goodness you hardly know it’s even beer. I’m struggling to get past the blueberry - but it’s so enticing I just want to get on to taste. There is some caramel maltiness and just a hint of yeasty fresh dough.Taste: Sweet and tart, blueberry obviously - but there is a slight pucker of lemon in there too - all mixed with a very fresh spring water. The sourness is almost rhubarb-like without being too bitter. I’d also say there is a touch of saltiness under the subtle bitter and I absolutely love the blueberry infused aftertaste.Feel: Its bright, fresh, clean, and crisp. Relatively low carbonation in a medium body. The finish has a semi-dry mix of sensation - there is the tang of blueberry that gives way to slightly wooden feel - I can only imagine licking a nice and smooth cedar plank, but I imagine the texture is similar - I may have to actually lick some woods just to make sure I’m make a more informed explanation but I stick to this observation for now. there is a little bit of plant/grassiness in there too.Overall: Ba-Bam! wow, I’ve had a lot of fruity sours this summer, and let me tell ya, this is one of my favourites. Not sure if it’s because of the smell or the cool aftertaste or just the whole kit and caboodle. Though I think if it smells the way it does I would have really amped up the blueberry in flavour. But it is crisp and refreshing, has a pretty good fruit flavour, not overly sour but a nice compromise and the sacrifice of sour for fruitiness works great here in my opinion just wish it had more now though. Not necessarily simple but not overly complex either. For me, this kettle sour is one of the best ones I’ve had that is not citrus based. Pairing: I just want to capitalized on the blueberries a bit - so I’m actually going to whip up a batch of crêpes right now before I finish this bottle (waffles will work just as well) - with a light berry syrup (corn syrup, strawberries, cherries, and a little sugar - heated in a saucepan) and topped with a couple swirls of whipped cream. I’m pretty sure it will work out great! Keeping it relatively light, capitalize on the fruitiness and throw in a bit of fat/weight to make up for lightish medium body, and pounce on that blueberry blast.Sep 03, 2016', ""Move over, Pumphouse. You may serve yours with blueberries in the glass at your brewpub, but this is now the best blueberry beer I've tasted. Pours a cloudy, purplish colour without much head.

Served well-chilled.Pours a clear amber-orange colour, topped with two fingers of frothy, foamy off-white head that erupts to the top of the glass. Kind of looks like marshmallow fluff as it slowly dies away, leaving lots of sticky lacing behind. Very nice. Nothing special to report on the nose - pale malts, leafy hops, some weak citrus and metallicity - and that's about it. At first I thought maybe the prodigious head was just covering some of it up, but nope; this is just the way it smells. Passable for a pale ale, I guess.Tasty stuff, with more of a malt bent than the other pale ale that was in this sampler. Bready malts and caramel start us off, leading into some mild lemon and bergamot orange citrus. It dries out toward the finish with some pleasant grassiness, with a slightly fruity aftertaste that leaves a bitter, citric feel behind on the palate. Medium-bodied, with a mild bite from the carbonation and a smooth, almost creamy mouthfeel - but to be fair, I poured this rather aggressively, so there was a lot of head and probably a lot of lost carb. Potentially sessionable, as this one scratches most of my pale ale itches. Final Grade: 3.64, a B grade. Dead Frog Brewing's Pale Ale isn't an attention-grabber, and I knew from the second I saw the less-than-impressive aggregate score that it probably wasn't very hoppy - but this is still an enjoyable, well-balanced pale ale that I could see myself picking up again, should six-packs ever become available here.

There is also a bit of a metallic flavour and some grains.Overall - An above average beer but far from exciting. Perhaps a good gateway beer to get others into craft,Aug 13, 2013', ""On-tap at the Original Joe's in Abbotsford, BC.This beer appears a clear medium orangish brown colour, with one finger of soapy off-white head, which leaves some sparse droopy lace around the glass as it quickly abates. It smells faintly of pale biscuit malt, and equally tame soapy, floral hops. The taste is a stronger, more assertive biscuit malt, and floral, weedy hops. The carbonation is fairly noticeable, and the body medium weight, and generally smooth. It finishes sweet and bready, some biscuit edge still evident.An adequate pale ale, but it could very well do with a swift dose of hops, any kind.Jul 01, 2011"", ""First one I've tried since backwoods became Dead Frog. I enjoyed a couple pints of this on the patio of the Greek restaurant at Crescent beach.Deep-bronze/amber with an off-white head. Very thin ring of retention, very little lace.Grainy biscuit, citrus & rind in the aroma & flavour. Modest bitterness.Light to moderate body, doesn't seem as big as it is. An easy drinker.I can see this as a bit of a transition brew. There's some nice pacific northwest flavour here, but not too much for the average drinker (and the bitterness seems relatively light for the style). I'd session this.Jul 31, 2009"", 'Bottle: Poured an amber color ale with a large foamy head with average retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of dry caramel malt with light dry hops as well. Taste is dominated by not overly complex dry caramel malt with very little hops apparent. Body is about average with good carbonation. Standard pale ale with little character but no flaws as well.Jun 11, 2009', ""Comes in a clear bottle with the brewery's logo embossed onto the glass.Pours out a deep rustic amber/nutty brown in hue, decent tight frothy white head with good retention.Bready toffee malt, nuts, faint twiggy grassy hops and some detergent on the nose.Flavour lacks a certain cohesion, the characteristics don't seem to mesh with one another. Almost tastes like a cross between a pale ale and a brown ale. Starts out with earthy toasted malt, yet the flavour gets washed out by the middle, while hops don't seem to make an appearance until well into the aftertaste, faint and herbal. A husky nutty character long into the aftertaste too.Mouthfeel is a nice creamy medium body, smooth across the palate.Impressive appearance and mouthfeel on this pale ale, the head lasts until the very end, however things don't get pulled together within the flavour department, which in the end leaves off giving just an average impression.Apr 17, 2009"", 'Ruddy caramel brown with a half finger of beige head. Clear body. Decent head retention.Toasty aroma with a herbal hop lean. Some citrus fruitiness as it warms.Malts give a bready flavour with a touch of caramel. Hops finish the flavour with a touch of citrus. Well balanced, some may say too balanced for a pale ale, but it leads to a very drinkable beer.Fair body for the style with a very soft yet lively carbonation. Nice and smooth to feel.Would make for a very nice session brew. Nothing extreme about it, but everything is pleasant.Jan 31, 2009', 'Had this at an airport hotel in Vancouver - an expected, and excellent offering.A - Pours a hazy light brown with a creamy white head. Seemed to have a greenish tinge to the liquid, but maybe that was my tie...S - Quite fruity and also yeasty with some citric hops.T/M - Fruity and yeasty with a not-quite-cask-light softness. A little tart up front, moderate hop, and a light grainy undertone. Aftertaste is muted. Excellent balance.D - Very drinkable, sessionable ale.May 21, 2008', ""Formerly Backwoods brewing, this interestingly monickered brewery is showing up in more and more establishments in Vancouver. Their pale ale is a very nice hoppy take on the style. Hop nose, orange gold body and fair head. Tastes somewhat like Blue Truck from Phillips this is perfect food friendly beer that has more body than most BC pale ale's.Worth orderingJul 28, 2007""]",/beer/profile/14598/37938/
Dead Frog Brewing,pilsner,Pilsner - German,5%,2,3.58,"['Sep 19, 2015']",['3.83'],1,"[""1ml bottle, the apparent guest brew in the current Dead Frog mixed pack. Dubbed 'Pilsner', plain and simple.This beer pours a slightly hazy, pale golden yellow colour, with a near-teeming tower of puffy, rocky, and rather chunky bone-white head, which leaves a crazy array of broken webbed lace around the glass as it slowly ebbs away.It smells of gritty, grainy pale malt, white saltine crackers, a twinge of gasohol, and leafy, earthy, and fairly grassy hops. The taste is bready, crackery pale malt, a softer indistinct graininess, subtle petrol esters, a bit of lemon/lime rind fruitiness, and some leafy, weedy, and still quite grassy hop bitterness.The carbonation is nice and testy in its alternating fizzy and frothy ministrations, the body a decent medium weight, and not particularly smooth, as a certain hoppy and gassy astringency kind of stomps all over the place, but somehow it's not really that big of a deal. It finishes trending dry, as the crackery malt mind melds with the lingering green hops.A more or less slavish attempt (or ode, if you prefer) to mimic the better versions of the style from 'die alte Welt'. Generally crisp, and good at inviting, nay, insisting that one take another slug sooner, rather than later. Glad I got the chance to give this one a go!Sep 19, 2015""]",/beer/profile/14598/191431/

This beer appears a slightly hazy, medium golden yellow colour, with one anemic finger of flat, wispy, and faintly bubbly off-white head, which leaves very little in the way of lace in the vicinity of the glass as things evenly subside. It smells of apple wine, bready and doughy pale malt, white grape juice, and a mild earthy yeastiness. The taste is gritty and grainy pale malt, a lesser caramel sweetness, mixed grapes, stewed apples, subtle rainbow peppercorn notes, and some understated leafy, weedy, and grassy noble verdant hoppiness. The carbonation is fairly benign in its bored-seeming frothiness, the body a decent middleweight, and generally smooth, with a thin airy creaminess evolving as we warm up a tad around here. It finishes well off-dry, the malt and lingering pome and grape fruitiness making it just so.Overall, this is a rather simple, and well-made version of the style, easy-drinking and enjoyable on another hot summer afternoon (like we really get all that many of them!). Worth checking out, as there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of selection, as such, for Kölsch around these parts (sorry, Alley Kat!).Jul 30, 2017"", 'I had this beer on-tap at the brewery in a big 20oz glass.Appearance: medium golden hue with a clear body and a thin layer of ivory foam. Not too bad.Smell: sweet, yeasty and a little beery. Not bad for the style.Taste: sweet and malty with a light graininess and a dash of noble hops. Quite reasonable.Mouthfeel: medium-light body with a bit carbonation. I like it.Overall: a very drinkable beer, and a successful Kölsch. I dig it!Feb 17, 2016', 'From a bottleLook: Spattering of polka dot foam floating over a light bronze sea. Smell: Rather generic malt aroma veering into scent neutrality. Taste: An incredibly delicate sweetness derived from sunny cereals and grains fresh from a wheelbarrow. However, there are some metallic flecks mixed within which are not unpleasant. Feel: Some chewiness in the near absent carbonation. There is also a subtle numbing of the cheeks followed by a dry finish. Overall: This is a gentle beer passing phantasmal-like through the nose and mouth. An invitation extended to a honeybee would have enhanced the aromatics and taste.Feb 13, 2016']",/beer/profile/40725/178813/

First straight-up offering from this Lotus-land brewery for this reporter.This beer appears a clear, medium golden yellow colour, with one skinny finger of wispy and weakly foamy off-white head, which leaves some decent webbed lace around the glass as things quickly abate.It smells of semi-sweet, grainy and doughy caramel malt, a lesser rye astringency, some candied tropical fruitiness, mild earthy yeasty notes, and further leafy, weedy, and floral green hop bitters. The taste is much more rye-forward in its malt profile, with a big breakfast cereal presence, some generic stone fruitiness, middling yeast, and more leafy, weedy, and dead grassy verdant hoppiness. The carbonation is adequate in its plebeian frothiness, the body a solid middleweight, and mostly smooth, with very little else going on here.

Hoppy with cereal malt backing and a touch of evergreen.Grapefruit flavours start - dominant hop - bright and bitter - citrus and resinous pine - bitterness builds but enough balancing malt sweetness.Medium mouthfeel - a bit of warming booziness but lingering hop bitterness carries through past the liquid in the glass.Dec 30, 2019', 'Clear amber color. Poured a head of medium sized bubbles. No lacing. Very few bubbles rising.Very hoppy smell with some yeast and a hint of barnyard. Swirling the glass kicked up a yeasty bread and malt smell with a bit more barnyard.Starts with a very smooth malt flavor that evolves to bitters and hoppy flavors. The aftertaste is mostly bitter hops with a touch of barnyard.Tongue tingling as it bursts into a thick foam. Much more carbonation in the mouth than appears in the glass. Medium heavy body, mostly from the feel of the dense foam.Excellent balance of flavors pushes through the very hoppy base. This is a good reference for an IPA.

There's something unique in there though that I can't quite nail down.The sip brings more of the hop character forward with citrus and some earthy hop notes that aren't quite pine aren't quite grassy, maybe almost kind of floral in the delicate nature... and eventually ending up in pine and citrus. Nice dull bitter finish that lingers.Super smoothe, this thing is disappearing from my glass more quickly than I intend.

A lot of people expect a super hop bomb with every IPA and miss the true beauty of the style, this one was refreshing and had the perfect hop bite. While lacking much of a head the flavor was solid and had a medium mouthfeel with slightly firm aftertaste which cleared before the next sip, a very easy drinking brew that would be good anytime.

Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into an unmarked pint glass.A: Very hazy orange-gold, with a low level of visible carbonation after the initial blush fades. Forms about a finger’s worth of white head with good retention.S: Citrus rind, sticky pine, and biscuit malts with significant amount of caramel sweetness. Smells like a standard of a bygone era of IPAs.T: The bitterest of grapefruit pith, and caramelized malts with accompanying big malty sweetness. Resinous bitterness as well. There’s a weird vegetal flavor – I think it\'s coming from the hops, but it\'s unwelcome here...almost plasticky. A significant bitterness in the hang, but not completely over the top, with some citrus pith flavors.M: Average body for style. The alcohol presence is low. Low carbonation sensation.O: I was surprised to see the ratings this beer has. Maybe there was something wrong with this bottle, but this isn\'t good. It\'s not quite a drain pour to me, but it\'s an ""actively avoid"" in the way of advice. First, there are many better IPAs and DIPAs available wherever you live. Secondly, the hop profile is completely boring – or at least old-school – but not really well done even with that as a standard. Plus the caramel malts are my least favorite IPA character. Lastly, the weird vegetal/plasticky flavor is off-putting. I\'m still not sure where it\'s coming from, but it\'s not good. Anyway, drinkable at best...but not by much.Oct 28, 2017', ""From a 650ml bottle served almost straight from the fridge at 10 degrees Celsius into a stemmed IPA glass.

Fingers crossed.Look: The beer pours a slightly veiled amber with 6cm of moussy, rocky, tan head that settles into a craggy though solid cap within 5+ minutes. Good lacing with persistent retention. Great-looking beer.Smell: Leaning towards mild intensity and sharp balance. Dominating hops with a faint, supportive pale malt. Pungent with resinous pine, citrusy grapefruit, and a faint, perfumy floral character. I really like it but I wish it hit me slightly harder. I'm also noticing a faint, fatty, cheesy off-note that makes me suspect a form of contamination. Since the bottle is only a few months away from expiry, who knows what the beer has gone through at this point.Taste: Moderate strength and bitter. Very much in line with the aroma. Hop-forward with notes of resinous pine, citrusy grapefruit, and tropical fruit. The finish is of medium length and bitter with moderate intensity and a minute mineral character.Feel: Medium body with moderate carbonation. Creamy and round with smooth alcohol warming that is light in character. The beer has quite a presence in the mouth.Overall: A very good, clean American IPA with decent complexity and strong bitterness. Great value - try it if you're into the style. As I mentioned under the aroma, I suspect something is gone wrong with this sample. I'm looking forward to trying the beer fresh and possibly rating it even higher.Sep 10, 2017"", 'A really nice surprise. Pours golden hay with decent head that lasted fairly well. Very good nose!

Aroma is intense grapefruit some pine notes malt sweetness almost indistinguishable at these hopping rates. In the flavour the hoppiness adds a slight grassiness. Citrus still dominant but the bitterness is pretty clean through the mouth and now some sweetness appears - mostly melon and honey. This is a beer for hopheads without doubt but that does not mean that it is uncomplicated. This beer is strong and hoppy but not overwhelming. I am a little surprised to see it called a Northwestern IPA because its malt profile and appearance seem to me to be closer to a New England IPA.Aug 25, 2017', ""This is a local IPA for me. It's an intense hop-heavy IPA with a bright nose and strong malt backbone. It's like eating a grapefruit dipped in caramel.

A satisfying brew that's far too easy to drink. A very good example of the PNW American IPA style. and one of very few decent Canadian IPAs I have found. For those in the BC market, I would state Fat Tug is (objectively and hands-down) a MUCH better beer than Steamworks Flagship IPA...which I only mention because the latter was --- somehow, incredibly --- just voted Best BC Craft Beer (!??).

The beer is a light-golden color with just a hint of haze and some carbonation to be seen.S-The aroma is snappy and hop-forward like you would expect from something that bills itself as a NW IPA. The flavors lean towards earthy and citrusy (like orange zest and grapefruit) instead of juicy or tropical. Malts are not completely overwhelmed and there is a good biscuit and bread aroma.T-The taste, like the smell, is zesty and sharp versus outright bitter. I taste pine, some grapefruit, orange zest. It is a bit vague, but that is probably my palate letting me down, not the beer. Pale biscuit-y malts are mild, but not completely missing.M-The beer has a great feel with a medium heft and a semi-crisp carbonation. It drinks mostly clean, but leaves a little bit of hop residue on my palate.O-This is a solid IPA that I would probably drink regularly if I lived in the area.

Could smell the hops in this one from a foot away even through the thick head, get you excited to dig into it. Tastes balanced without overwhelming bitterness. Citrus, pine hops.

Good presentation and overall does not let you down when you follow your nose.Mar 03, 2016', 'A: Pours a hazy medium to dark honey orange in color with moderate to heavy amounts of fine active carbonation and some moderate copper + golden yellow highlights. The beer has a two finger tall foamy tan head that slowly reduces to a medium sized half finger thick cap towards the center of the glass surrounded by a thin film covering the majority of the remainder of the surface of the beer and a thick ring at the edges of the glass. Significant amounts of lacing are observed.S: Moderate to strong aromas of pine/resin/dank hops with moderate aromas of citrus/grapefruit rind and herbal hops over the top of grainy malts.T: Upfront there is a moderate flavor of grainy + caramel malts with a moderate amount of brown sugar sweetness. That is followed by moderate to strong flavors of citrus/grapefruit, citrus/grapefruit rind, pine/resin/dank, and herbal hops which contribute a moderate amount of lingering bitterness.M: Slightly heavier than medium bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. Chewy with a hint of dryness in the finish.O: Very enjoyable and I wonder how great this one would be really fresh... Really nice hop flavors and aromas with a nice combination of citrus and pine.

Decent aroma and pretty low malt. Overall would buy againFeb 18, 2016', 'Look: The body is transparent and amber. There is a visible on-going and static carbonation. The beer produces a three-finger white head that is not just creamy, but also foamy on the top. As the beer is consumed, it leaves resilient traces of head that take ages to disappear.Smell: The nose has notes of zests of citrus, mangos and a little bit of pine woods.Taste: This IPA is well balanced. The malts have a taste of mango, peach and a little bit of honey. The finish tasted like smoked hops and there was a little bit of spice because of the subtle carbonation. The pine woods come in.Feel: The beer is full-bodied. Despite its high volume alcohol, the warmth of the alcohol is barely felt on the taste buds as well as in the throat, which is unusual for an IPA. This is the most bitter Canadian IPA I have ever had. Although the beer is dry, it is not astringent and it barely dehydrate the mouth.Overall: For a North American beer, this beer stood out because of its perfect head retention. Each flavour has the right amount of time to shine before making a transition to another flavour. I would recommend it.Feb 15, 2016', ""This one gets an across the board 4.25, Usually I'm not the biggest fan of IPA's that are very piney, this had a good balance but both Pine and citrus flavors were big but it was very well refined!Appearance - poured from a 650 ml bottle into a crystal snifter (parents glassware lol). This beer poured a clear golden color with a finger of head that lasted a little while. Carbonation looked pretty lively.Aroma - The first aromas to hit my nose, were big citrus notes, I got grapefruit, orange, a little mango, then a strong pine after that followed by some light caramel malts. Taste - the flavor profile followed suit all the same flavors and you get hit with a strong bitterness around the time the pine comes in which is then mellowed by the caramel.Feel - This beer had a medium-full body which was nice, Most IPA's ive had tend to sit on the other side of the medium spectrum, It had a very creamy body also and was smooth on the finish.

Nice lacing.There\'s the expected grapefruit and pine, plus some gentler floral and fruity aromas. It\'s very west coast, but not in that aggressively dank ""let\'s rip a couple bong hits"" way some of these IPAs can be. The fruitiness of (I\'m guessing) Centennial hops is certainly the dominant note here. The aromatic hops are balanced by some bitterness and just the right amount of malt sweetness.Creamy and effervescent.This is a classic west-coast IPA.

Given Fat Tug's great reputation, I had very high expectations and this completely lived up to them. It also probably supplanted Red Racer as my favourite BC IPA, that I've had the pleasure to enjoy.Jan 14, 2016"", ""650 mL bomber served slightly chilled. I had heard that the LCBO was bringing this in, but did not expect it to be stocked locally. What a nice surprise!Pours a translucent golden-amber hue, complete with a pillowy, sparkling white-coloured head about two fingers high. Good retention; it seeps away steadily over the next 5-10 minutes, depositing a gorgeous curtain of scattered lace, and eventually receding to a half-cm of dense, creamy foam. Citrusy orangepeel and grapefruit come through on the nose, as do pronounced pine needle and resin notes. I'm also getting a few hints of peach, lychee and honeydew melon, with a touch of caramel.Oh man, it's been a while since I've had the chance to experience a brand new top shelf IPA. The hops are supported by a respectable shelf of biscuity malts and caramelized sugar sweetness, but this one focuses mostly on the resiny, piney hop flavours. Subtle flavours of apricot, canteloupe and passion fruit are easily lost amidst the resin - and they don't fare any better once you hit the citrus-forward back end, which is dominated by pithy grapefruit and a combination of grassy, floral, herbal bitterness at the finish. Bitter, resiny aftertaste that persists well after each sip. Full-medium body, with delicate carbonation levels and an exceedingly smooth, soft, borderline creamy feel on the palate. No sign of the alcohol really, so it drinks like a dream; this is exactly what I am looking for in this style.Really glad to finally cross this long-time want off my list... and given the reasonable price I'll probably pick up a few more bombers.[Updated Jan 28 2020]I haven't seen any Fat Tug at an LCBO for a while now, and this is the first time it has come in a convenient tallboy format (best before May 21 2020). This remains one of the most fawning reviews I've ever given any kind of IPA, because at the time I felt it exemplified the best qualities of the West Coast style in particular. Revisiting it for the first time in a while, I feel no particular compulsion to change a thing, because this is absolutely still one of the best, smoothest IPAs I've ever had. The hazy and milkshake-type IPAs that have mesmerised consumers and brewers alike as of late may (or may not) eventually prove to be fads... but you can't fake quality, and the depth of Fat Tug's is abyssal.

A bit of crackery base malt. Slight bile. Faintly oily texture, but light-moderate carbonation and light-moderate body.

The taste is more gritty, grainy pale malt, a suggestion of biscuity caramel, peppy pine resin and citrus pith (white grapefruit and underripe navel orange, for the trainspotters), that same flinty essence carrying on from the nose, and a respectful cold steely alcohol, er, warming.The bubbles are quite innocuous in their quotidian and frothy meanderings, the body a solid enough middleweight, and replete with a hollow-seeming smoothness. It finishes on a strong drying trend, the fruity and bitter green hop essences justifying their purported skin in the game.Well, the long-term hype machine is justified, it would seem - this is a stand-up, big-boy hoppy IPA, the malt paid only contractual lip service (wait, whut?).

The taste follows the nose but heavier on the pine flavors and a little grassy maybe - very well balanced with no flavors dominating the palate and a gentle bitterness at the sides of the mouth.

Good, but the carbonation could be turned down a bit.Overall, very good. Not quite as explosively good as I had hoped for, but very enjoyable and something that I could imagine drinking a lot of- it goes down very easily. More malt than expected, but I like it.Dec 20, 2013', ""Fat Tug IPA is a clear, copper wire coloured ale with the complexion of ghee (clarified butter). Such a tone, though clean, turns transparency into mere translucency; it's like looking through a block of ice. Its head is built like a wrestler - stout and thick - and piledrives foam onto the glass. The nose boasts papaya and mango in both their fresh, vividly citric as well as candied, dried states. There's also an accompanying cast of grapefruit, melon, lime, lychee and even a spritz of guava. It is a market of exotic, tropical fruits with an overlay of dank, grassy herbals.The flavour is so full of pine needles, lawn clippings and orange wedges that all the honey and eggbread flavour from the malts goes largely unnoticed. Even as far as sweetness goes, the candied citrus and guava notes are right on par with any notions of caramel or toffee. For the craft beer lover, hops reach the brain's pleasure zones via the same neurological circuitry as salt, sugar, or fat - it's an innate craving that provides an immediate hit. And like the latter, sometimes you just can't get enough. Fat Tug IPA certainly hits that 'bliss point'. It was some time before Canadian brewers offered the same kind of juicy, citric IPAs that made their American counterparts famous - those days are over. Between Driftwood's Fat Tug and Central City's Red Racer, I don't think one even has to leave the province of British Columbia!Nov 29, 2013"", 'A great IPA.

This unassuming 22 ounce bottle packs 80 IBUs of unrelenting diesel power! Let this Fat Tug pull you in slow and low to Hoppy Nirvana..."" Brewed in the style of an American IPA. This beer is one of Driftwood\'s mainstays.Poured from a 22 oz. bottle to a pint glass. Served north of 50º Fahrenheit.(Appearance) Pours a sudsy froth head of a golden cream tone over a mildly hazy amber body with moderate carbonation. Retention is above average, lacing is medium-dense and clingy. It\'s an unfiltered IPA, which leads to a slight uncommon haziness. 4(Smell) Aromas of pine, citrus ream and tropical fruit over a light bready caramel and pale malt base. This isn\'t a striking or overly bright-smelling IPA but it does have an enjoyable hop aroma, modest in presentation, it stands at par with the malt profile. A mild peppery character is a curious addition, perhaps suggesting a hint of rye. Potency is medium. 4(Taste) Up front, the malt bill is relatively clean and a touch viscous, with a lightly toasted barley malt, some biscuity malt, questionably rye, and most notably by the sweet, slick finish, a pinch of honey malt, or just honey. There\'s a good balance between the malt character and hop bitterness, although the hop flavors aren\'t very charismatic, there\'s a substantial bitterness to confirm this as a bold IPA. 4(Mouthfeel) Texture is slick first, smooth second. Carbonation plays a mellow role in adding some air to the texture, but keeps very tame, more so compared to American IPAs. Balance is slightly bitter over sweet, although it remains close, with a fuller body than expected. Body is medium/high for an American IPA, medium+ overall. The beer finishes favorably bitter with a clean, very slick and resinous finish. 4.5(Overall) Victoria\'s Driftwood Brewery crafts a thoroughly enjoyable American IPA, with a solid malt sweetness and a moderate hop flavor and bitterness to pair, it\'s a more heavy-drinking IPA than I\'m used to, but a treat to savor nonetheless.

It is impressively crisp and dry with zero booze despite being 7%Mouthfeel- This might be the highlight of the beer. I love a nice crisp clean IPA and this certainly fits the bill. It is heavy enough to be satisfying but light enough where it isn't coating your mouth.Overall- Really glad I got to try this one; it definetly should be in the conversation of best IPA.

Well, second first date. Nevermind.Pour is an unclear but not hazy orange with gentled carbonation. Nose is a fall cornucopia of fruits: honeydew, grapefruit, orange, pale malts. Going in the correct direction. Fat Tug begs for a comment, so I'm not going to make one. Lovely hops on this babe, reaching out & giving the tongue a good shlap of bitterness, followed with fainter flavors of pine, citrus. The bitterness doing the tugging here. Nice pale malts, light sweetness. Drinkable. I could do this bomber. Nice IPA that showcases bitterness, but without a whole lot of complexity. Luckily, that's my favorite part of an IPA. Very good beer.Mar 26, 2013"", 'Picked up a bottle of this at a BCLS earlier this wonderful evening. Unfortunately, Driftwood doesn\'t yet date their bottles, so I have no idea how fresh this is. Given that this IPA is somewhat hop-heavy, that is somewhat important and should probably be rectified sooner rather than later.I\'m fairly familiar with this beer. Actually, I guess I should rephrase that: I thought I was familiar with this beer. It had a nice hop profile and proved to be really easy drinking for being 7% ABV, although as time went on, I found it to be somewhat bottom-heavy. The initial mouthfeel was great, but the aftertaste was a bit too bitter and not as crisp as some of the IPAs I\'d had from the golden land of Californy. In the interim, I even took a trip down to San Francisco in January and overloaded on some pretty amazing IPAs and DIPAs. I came back to BC thinking that BC IPAs would never compare to the stuff I\'d had down there. For the most part, I was right. Central City IPA was a bit too malty and I had to double check the can to make sure I didn\'t pick up the ESB on accident, the hop profile being less impressive than I had remembered; Switchback IPA was better, with a nice hop profile, citrusy and piny and crisp, although it had a very familiar beta acid bitterness on the end of the aftertaste.And then I finally found a bottle of Fat Tug IPA. I approached it with apprehension. Before my trip to CA, I viewed it as a great IPA -- one of the best brewed in BC, alongside Hop Therapy (different classes, obviously). I didn\'t want to ruin that impression. As it turns out, my fears were completely misplaced, because this is an even better beer than I remembered it to be. I\'m not sure if it was just because I had a really fresh bottle (and with BCLS, it\'s really hard to tell, not to mention they don\'t refrigerate their beers) or they tweaked the recipe or what, but it surprised the hell out of me.The appearance is a somewhat hazy golden amber with a pretty great off-white head and lacing on the glass. The initial smell is a gorgeous citrusy hop smell, with some bready malts way at the back. The taste is really crisp citrus hops. As you allow the taste to permeate, you begin to notice a fairly solid malt backing that adds a great balance to the beer (something that I\'d never really noticed before). The aftertaste was surprisingly light and fairly crisp. Like I said, this was pretty astounding to me as I remember the aftertaste being a lot heavier and way more bitter but, again, I\'m not sure if it\'s just due to the fact that I had a really fresh bottle or if Driftwood tweaked their recipe any. Driftwood plz add bottling dates to your IPAs ok thanks :(Overall, I\'m really glad I revisited this beer. It used to be really good for BC IPAs, now I can say with certainty that it\'s better than most of the IPAs I\'ve had in the Pacific Northwest and maybe only a notch or so below the best (single) IPAs found in Southern California. This seems like a somewhat back-handed compliment but it really isn\'t. Trust me.Edit: as of March 2013, Driftwood has started printing bottling dates on the cap of their beers. Truly the Best Brewery.Edit: as of July, 2016, ehhh. I feel this IPA has seen better days. I feel it used to be the flagship for the BC scene, but, I feel like it\'s becoming outdated once again. I still think it\'s an enjoyable beer, from a personal point of view, but I\'ve had so much better from around BC - Juxtapose, Frank IPA from Machine Brewing, Fuggles & Warlock\'s IPAs (Cannon IPA, to start with - and not ""officially"" an IPA, but their Icarus Mosaic Saison is basically a single-hopped farmhouse IPA, and it\'s one of the best things I\'ve had in BC since Nectarous)Anyway, my point is, I\'m gonna have to re-adjust the rating for this beer a bit. It\'s still damn good, and I still go for it when I feel like a chewy IPA to graze on. But it\'s no longer my standard.Feb 08, 2013', ""Wow, excellent beer!

Much appreciated! From a bomber into a snifterBest by 13 December 2012IBU: 80 APPEARANCE: Pours a two finger, thicker looking, fluffy white head with great retention. Head slowly fades to a full wisp and coats the top of the glass. Light burnt orange in color, perfectly clear with no carbonation. A splotchy wisp remains until the close and leaves some decent lacing down the glass. Looks great. SMELL: Big nose full of pale malts, honeydew melon, pineapple, mango and tangerine aromas. Lots of tropical fruits and plenty forthcoming. Great stuff. TASTE: Follows the nose nicely. Pale malts, caramel, and lots of tropical fruits up front. Pineapple, orange and tangering through the middle, then a good dose of piney, bitter hops at the swallow. Bold and lingering aftertaste of bitter piney and floral hops, sweet melon and pineapple as balance. Lots of bitter hops linger on the palate. Very flavorful for sure, but just need a slightly fuller body for top marks. PALATE: Medium body and medium carbonation. Semi-creamy on the palate, goes down fine and finishes dry. Could be slightly creamier and fuller, but nothing wrong here. OVERALL: This was excellent and definitely lived up to expectations. Great nose and amazing flavors, though the average palate sold it short somewhat. With a creamier and fuller body, the flavors would come out a little more and you'd have a world class experience on your hands.

Top class stuff!Oct 03, 2012"", ""I have reviewed this previously on tap from the Alibi Room in Vancouver. I got hold of an incredibly fresh bottle all the way out in Fernie, BC while I was up from Montana. I must say, this beer's delicate hop character translates incredibly well into bottled form. The hop profile is very untraditional, the citrus is there, but it plays second hand to the more forward melon and mango characters. Usually I can tell what hops went into a beer, this one I am absolutely stumped. For me, it checks almost everything on the list, I have not complaints. It is a one of a kind IPA, and it is the work of brewers that clearly know what they are doing. I hope to see more brewers coming up with unique IPAs like this one.Aug 24, 2012"", 'On-tap at The Whip in Vancouver, BC.Pours a bright, coppery orange colour, with a mild, but filmy head of off-white. Patchy, sudsy, crackly lace forms as the head subsides. Strong streaming carbonation races through the solid body. Looks nice.Nose is pungent and sharp with under-ripe orange, laced with stewed fruits and butterscotch. Simcoe, my old friend? Slight mild piney greenness pokes its head in as well. It\'s OK, but it really pushed all my ""Warning! Warning! Generic American IPA Alert!"" buttons.Flavour is similar. There\'s no intrinsic sweetness to the brew, but the hops lend a caramel stewed sweetness to the mix that cloys with the big direct bitterness. The light feel on the palate means that there\'s a really pronounced hop vector slicing bitterly across the tongue. Finish is bunched and compressed, but stretched longitudinally at the back of the palate, giving a broad residual alpha bitterness.I was shocked when I saw how highly this beer is regarded on BA. This really felt like a pretty standard, if highly-hopped IPA, that didn\'t really think about the balance in its flavour profile.

Whooee, a delicious aroma of herbal hops, pineapple and light fruit wafted from the glass as I poured this ale, one of the more complex aromatic IPAs I've run into. The flavor does not disappoint from the tempting pour. Caramel malt, intense piney and herbal hops tapering into a citrusy malt and hop finish leaving pleasant hop aftertaste.

The head keeps growing and growing on top of a amber, creamy, swirling body and leaves beautiful lacing.The smell betrays the piney hops the minute you open the bottle. This was obviously dry-hopped - to near perfection. The taste is insane. Very, very bitter. Mostly piney hops, but balanced quite nicely with malt. There's a strong citrus element to this as well. Lots of grapefruit in this one. And creamy! The finish is just a tad less than 'dry' despite all the hops. Overall, this is one hell of a beer.

It's extremely hoppy at 80 IBUs, but very easy to drink and goes great with any hearty meal - or it goes great with eating nothing at all. It really packs a nice sufficient punch by the end but you can't help but go back for more. This might very well be my favourite beer from any BC brewery at this moment; I'm blessed that I can find this in liquor stores and on tap in the area, even if you have to pay a bit of a premium at $6.50 per 650mL for it.At a penny a millilitre, it's worth it, 100%. Do yourself a favour and check it out.Nov 27, 2011"", 'I love the s*** out of the beer. I first had it about a year ago but it is unavailable here in Toronto so I stocked up on my last trip to BC. Driftwood is one of the best breweries in Canada because the beers are true to their styles and consistent. So, this beer is a textbook IPA. The colour is a fine hazy apricot with white head. The complex smells are rad: citrus, resin, peaches, subtle ammonia. It tastes of grapefruit, tangerine, with a lingering herbaceous and dominant bittering. The flavour arrives in waves first with a grapefruit, citrus flood surge followed by a light refreshing ebb and finally you get the tsunami of bitter. F**k yeah!The mouth feel is pleasingly dry based on a 7% abv (which is well hidden otherwise) and generous hopping.Now as far as presentation goes they do a great job. They have unique graphic design and plastic easy to peal labels the likes of which I haven\'t seen before. The bottles are exclusively in the 650ml format and away you f**king go.When its done you will think to yourself ""Man, I could really treat myself to a nice Fat Tug right now""Drink this well balanced IPA work of art with spicy curry and enjoy your burps.

Thin head, not much there but manages to throw some patches of lacing.Nose is sweet and tropical, hints of citrus rind and pine. West-coast influenced all the way, aromatic but not perhaps as involved and complex as some exemplars.Wonderful mix of tropical hops and bittering pine and grapefruit rind in the flavor, leaning to pine. Still a nice caramel sweet backdrop with hints of papaya and pineapple, malt is not too heavy though - lets the hops shine as the star, resiny and full of hop-burp goodness. Just a hint of alcohol in there as well, pretty smooth body, light carbonation. Great IPA, would by my go to I think - along with Red Racer.

T: nice bitter pinch with plenty of those bubble gum flavors and citric rinds. Just a hint of the malt comes thru this beast making it almost like a summer American ipa, but a blend of west coast and great lakes style hop scheduling.

No freshness dating to be found and it appears to be filtered/no sediment in the bottle. This brew appears a clear color of copper with a creamy topping of 2 fingers worth of rich yellowish stained head. There is a light amount of haze keeping this brew from being perfectly clear and bubbles rise to the surface in support of the head. As the cap slowly fades, it produces patches and spots of lacework all over the glass.The aroma of this brew is bright citrus hop notes that come across with a touch of pine and resinous rindy characteristics. There is a mild catty scent that dare i say suggests a touch of stinky cheese in there as well. A touch of grassiness lingers throughout which adds some nice depth. Overall quite enjoyable. As it warms, it picks up some toasted caramel malt scents that provide a light sweetness to this brew's scent.The taste of this brew is bitter with a rindy touch that immediately draws thoughts of alcohol grapefruit juice upon my first sip. It lingers with a resinous cling inside the mouth that turns a bit catty mixed with grassy notes but maintains a bitter fruity flavor consistently. There is a very mild sweetness to this brew that is a cross between rindy fruits like grapefruit and a sweetness somewhat like a toasted type of caramel malt. This brew finishes crisp and refreshing which is interesting for something in the 7% range.There is a solid warming factor from the alcohol's inclusion, that 7% abv is felt through and through without any suppression. However, the alcohol is well integrated and enjoyable with the flavors that exist. It is medium bodied and modestly carbonated. Overall well balanced and enjoyable, I would certainly drink this again if given the opportunity.May 15, 2011"", 'shout out to rutager and thank you, 22 oz bomber split between myself and fellow BA and this review is coming from the notes...orange haze with golden shit coming through (i really wrote that wtf) i dunno. 2 fingers of off white head reduced to a layer tight bubbles. did not show great lacingA - sweet fruits up front, touch of lemony aroma, more citrus and hints of pineapple in particular. Pale malt background very subtle which is submissive to the citrusy aromas. T - The citrus is much less dominant that was present in the nose, getting a piney sap which is new, hints of orange peel dryness along with a sharp bitterness in the back, again the malts are there...barely... but push for a balance. no alcohol is present.M - light to medium body moderate carbonation, slight prickly finish O - this brew is solid and i would like to have it again, the orange peel dryness is a bit too dominant for me but that may vary from batch to batch.

Served cold and split into two pint glasses, this was consumed on 04/24/2011.What a nice pour that came out of this one. A lighter than I would have expected amber color, was almost a golden pale with loads of carbonation and a huge billowing white head that sat on top with a large amount of foam that stuck to the sides and dripped down the glass.A huge aroma then came wafting through the air. Lots of orange rind, grapefruit, and hints of lemon that layer on top of a light grain and bready base that offers a nice touch of balance but without distracting from the real gem here that was the since hop. Very light for as strong as it was, I really did not expect that at all. It was almost trying to deceive you with its full strength as the light hops and lingering dryness in the flavor left you thirsting for more, but at over 10% you were quickly reminded of its real strength.Overall a very solid DIPA. It comes with a long line of simcoe forward big ipas that have come before it but this one really works. Besides you have to love the Canadian aspect to it, overall a hit and a nice way to roll into the mid afternoon.Apr 25, 2011', 'Pours a hazy orange colour, nice fluffy white head, good lace on the glass.

Recomended by the lovely, friendly girl behind the counter after asking about the sold out Deschutes Hop Trip which I intended to buy more of.

Smell: Piney, grapes and lemon.Taste: Hoppy indeed!! Pine-tree sap, crisp underipe grapefruit. Slight caramel and lemon. Mouthfeel. Oily bitterness that last just long enough. Medium carbonation. Alchohol present but very well hiddenDrinkability: Went through this too fast and wished I had another!! Looks like this will be added to the regular rotation for at least the next while. Overall: First Driftwood product for me and not a moment too soon. Will be keeping my eye out for this bad boy of a hop fix. Looking forward to trying more from these guys!!Jan 07, 2011', ""A low SRM and a nice spicy hop finish from Driftwood. One of BC's up and comers and I have been enjoying what they are doing so far. I never would have guessed 7% for the ABV it drinks a little lighter than that. Maybe having a DDC Chaman first wasn't the way to go in drinking beers tonight. I would have to try again to be fair to this brew. I like what this brewery is doing and hope some day we can by their products in Alberta. The hops slightly winning the battle with malt and that is not a bad thing.Dec 18, 2010"", ""Served a bit too warm - which I'd guess brought forward the maltsweetness.Clear gold color. Good slightly off-white head; bubbles on the coarse side.Smell: citrus, piney, and spicy.Taste: Hop presence is distinctly spicy, maybe grapefruit rind, or grapefruit with orange rind. Feels a bit hot for 7%. Mouth feel: initially a little thin, but then some creamy bubblesform. Maybe too many bubbles? Swallow leaves a back-of-the-mouth oily film.This strikes me as pretty drinkabie for 7%, 80 IBUs. A little one-dimensional, but over all I like what they've done with the spicy hops. Its biggest flaw is mouthfeel: too light and foamy ( this might be the result of the serving temperature, but if not it would still be great with a burger and fries).Dec 11, 2010"", 'Yum! A little bit more tame than Sartori, but a very powerful and hoppy IPA. Orangery-copper with a white head that is very chunky and clingy. Rich, hoppy smell. There is an initial hoppy blast followed up a sweet, bready malt. Citrusy, grassy fruit flavours. Malts are not dominant at all.Good carbonation, very nice beer even in a 7% bomber.Nov 13, 2010', ""Bomber purchased from Central City liquor store. Let's see how it compares to the coveted Red Racer IPA...Appearance: Slightly orange. Poured smoothly to nice creamy head. Dissipates over time.Smell: Pungent hoppy aroma. Not so much grapefruity like other IPA's. Green, piney hops with some biscuity notes.Taste: Wow this is hoppy! Lots of grassy, piney hoppiness. Very indicative of a well balanced west coast IPA. Reminds me of Phillips Hop Circle and LaConner IPA. Mouthfeel: Fat Tug definitely is a showcase for the IBU. All 80 (according to the bottle) come through strongly and boldly. Carbonation is spot on. Slight malty sweetness contrasts beautifully with the bitterness.Drinkability: If this were available in 6-packs, it'd be dangerous stuff. The alc/vol is high yet subtle in the taste. And the bitterness keeps it interesting.Overall: Another GREAT beer from Driftwood and yet another sign of the amazing BC craft beer scene. Tons of hops, and different enough from Red Racer to make it stand out on it's own as one of the great West Coast IPA's. PS. Apologies to Driftwood for the constant comparison to Central City(however it's inevitable these days with Red Racer's reputation). Driftwood is truly an innovator and leader in the BC craft beer movement. This, along with their Sartori, definitely solidifies them as one of BC's best brewers.Nov 10, 2010"", 'I finally tried one of these today, and it is definitely my favourite IPA of all those I can remember by name, and equal to an excellent one I remember having at an American micro-brew pub (in Long Beach; Rock Bottom brewery perhaps). By far better than the IPAs from other local micro breweries which I have always found underwhelming - one is too malty, the other not carbonated enough for my liking.The taste is very strong hops, with an amazing bitterness, and a delicious citrus-cannabis-bergamot aftertaste. No heavy malty flavours or anything to distract from this delicious hoppiness, and the hops taste fresh and, despite being very powerful, delicate. Nice carbonation; not too strong but not weak and syrupy either.Three thumbs up.Nov 09, 2010', ""The much anticipated IPA from Driftwood...A: Clear gold with a white head, great retention and lacing.S: Huge, perfumy aroma.

I'm not sure if there's quite as much finishing (aroma) hops, but there's plenty of flavour and a bit more bitterness. An all-around great brew!Nov 08, 2010"", ""I grabbed this at the local liquor store, only to realize it was just bottled today! You can't get much fresher than that, perfect for an IPA. The beer pours an ever so slightly hazy yellowy copper with a nice foamy head that lingers.

The freshness really shows, it smells like it finished dry hopping today!Bitterness punches strongly upfront with plenty of citrus and piney hop flavor. More earthy, and harsh grassiness in the flavor. The finish is bitter and almost pungently sour. The malt is there, but it is well hidden, it only pops up here and there.I look forward to seeing the beer on draft around Victoria, it is the most brutal IPA I've had from the Island.Oct 25, 2010""]",/beer/profile/18858/62911/

The head was coarse medium sized bubbles that quickly shrunk down to a thin skiff, leaving only a tiny bit of lacing. A moderate flux of medium sized bubbles were rising from the bottom of the glass.Smells like a straw or hay with barnyard. A little bit of sweet, almost floral hops show up. Swirling the glass boosts the barnyard, but this is a much milder and sweeter barnyard than we were getting everywhere during the summer.Medium bitter flavors give way to a soft malt and the milder barnyard that showed up in the scent. The hop floral flavor shows up towards the end. The aftertaste is a boost in bitters and then all the flavors slowly tail off.Slowly foams up, but feels more like a soft drink. The foam is rather persistent as it turns to larger bubbles. Medium to heavy body in the liquid before it foams.I had this scored a full point higher when I tried it a couple of years ago, before the barnyard took over the local beer scene. At that time I described it as having a nutty scent with a little cheese, neither of which showed up this time around. It has a lighter bitterness level for an IPA. This seems more like a light American IPA than a NEIPA. Once the barnyard is eliminated, this would be a good basic IPA, but nothing really stands out.Dec 31, 2019', 'Poured into pint glass. Almost 3 finger foam. Exceptional head, white foamy goodness! Fruit, namely orange, appears on the first taste. This merges into a nice, crisp hoppy mouthfeel. Further smelling reveals yeast, wet grass, a touch of pine and a bit of spice. Ultra, ultra smooth BC version of an IPA beer. 7% abv but no alcohol or booziness taste is present on the swallow - just juicy citrus and a crisp hop finish.The smell is ridiculously inviting. If this beer is in your vicinity, grab it, horde it and most importantly, drink it. A tad pricier than some but, totally justified. This is a world class beer kids, grab it while it exists.Jun 01, 2019', '16 oz can into snifter. Pours a beautiful clear pale golden with 2 fingers white head.

Caramel malt is there, but let’s the fruity hops star. Earthy, spicy yeast ties it all together.Mouthfeel: Light to medium body with moderate but relatively soft carbonation.Overall: A wonderfully balanced and drinkable IPA that shows off some nice fruity hop and spicy yeast notes.Nov 22, 2018', '100th review!Appearance - Pours a golden amber with three fingers of frothy white head that leaves some excellent lacing. Smell - tropical and citrus hops, tropical fruits, mango, pineapple, passionfruit, orange peel, bready caramel malts, and wild earthy spicy yeast.Taste - Nice punch from the tropical and citrus hops followed by the tropical fruits (mango, pineapple, and passionfruit). The citrus flavour of orange peel comes through next followed by the bready caramel malts and earthy spicy yeast. Mouthfeel - Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Finishes sticky with a pleasant lingering bitterness from the hops.Overall - An excellent IPA that showcases the tropical and citrus hops very well. The wild earthy spicy yeast adds a pleasant layer of additional flavours. A true stand out of an IPA.Dec 16, 2017', ""Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a medium golden amber with a fine three finger white head that stays constantly renewed by carbonation and thick lacing. Looks great. Aroma of caramel malt, citrus and tropical fruit hops, orange citrus, mango, passionfruit and light pineapple. Flavor follows, with moderate caramel malt, citrus, piney and tropical fruit hops, orange and lemon citrus, mango, passionfruit, pine. Finishes with lingering resinous piney and citrus hops with residual mixed fruit esters. Medium bodied with nice medium creaminess and peppery carbonation. This was recommended to me by the staff at Whatcom Wine & Spirits as a limited, but excellent IPA. My goal that day was to get new (to me) breweries, but due to their enthusiasm and my previous experience with Driftwood (all good), I picked this up. They were right, this is a fine IPA. It has both NW piney and citrus character to the hops as well as nice tropical fruit notes. And it all comes together very nicely. It seems like there should be too much going on here, but I found that the tropical fruit dominates the beginning of the taste and the finish is quite piney with citrus notes. Really glad I stumbled on this one. Driftwood occasionally drifted into Seattle, but I haven't seen any in quite a while and I'm now sorry; I had good memories of their offerings and hope to see them again. A recommended IPA if you are lucky enough to run across it. Really nice graphics on the bottle too. The full monty.Oct 04, 2017"", 'This the best Brett/ faux-brett IPA I have had.The yeast amplifies the hop flavor and nose without becoming the main attraction.

Medium bodied with finely frothy carbonation. Finishes dry.Verdict: Highly recommended. More sourness would have pleased me, but there's nothing to complain about here.Oct 26, 2016"", 'Bottle: Poured a hazy orangey color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of mango and tropical fruit notes with some light funky yeasty flavours. Taste is a great mix of mango, tropical fruits with light funky flavours with a solid malt backbone and light residual sugar notes. Body is full with great carbonation. Great used of Equinox hops with yeast presence not as discernable as I had expected.Oct 24, 2016', 'Enjoyed very fresh. This beer looked great, with a golden color and just a tinge of haze. A small head appears on the pour, but breaks relatively quickly, and there is some lacing left as it goes down. The smell is pure hops goodness, with the tropical notes of pineapple and other fruits. Damn nice. The taste follows the nose, though there is a malt presence that gives the beer a nice balance. This beer was very refreshing with medium carbonation and a dryish finish. Overall, a very enjoyable beer that I wish I could get my hands on again. It went down easy, and quenched my thirst quite nicely.Oct 21, 2016', ""50ml bottle - very stoked to finally see this brew arrive in Alberta. Cuing up some 'Boots or Hearts' from da Hip: 'even babies raised by wolves they know exactly when they've been used'.This beer pours a slightly hazy, medium golden yellow colour, with three fingers of puffy, rocky, and chunky off-white head, which leaves some sparse sudsy cloud form lace around the glass as it lazily recedes.It smells of big pineapple, apricot, Ataulfo mango, and honeydew fleshy fruit, bready and doughy caramel malt, subtle sour and funky bacterial infection notes, and more relatively understated leafy and piney green hop bitters. The taste is gritty and grainy caramel malt, some biscuity toffee, a still heady mixed tropical fruitiness, some yeast that is more spicy than funky (fuckin' eh!), over-sugared black tea, and a growing piney and grassy verdant hoppiness.The carbonation is fairly tame in its workaday frothiness, the body a solid middleweight, and rather smooth, even the local yeast essence not messing about here - fancy that! It finishes off-dry, the tropical fruitiness waning somewhat, while the base malt keeps 'er right between the ditches.Overall, this one more than earns its place in the best of class, as far as Canadian brews go - they make a wild ale that is not particularly wild, so it still appeals to all those sour beer freaks out there, yet the rest of us can savour the lovely tropical fruit esters with which this is riddled. Normally, when it starts to fall apart, man it really falls apart (I know), but ain't none of that happenin' here!Oct 05, 2016"", 'Love the huge tropical aromas.

Moderate dissipation and gorgeous lines of lace clinging desperately to the glass as it mellows out. Rocky like bubble formations are left on the surface and stick around for quite a while.Aromatics: Hehehe, it’s been at least a decade since I’ve smelled some dank funky m.j. - and yet that was the first descriptor note I came across. And it isn’t even the dominant feature. Plenty of citrus fruit - grapefruit, lemon, and a little cactus nectar. Some indirect fragrance as well - sweeter tropical notes guava and mango. And all halo’d in a floral blanket. Sigh… this is what potpourri should smell like.Taste: Grapefruit bitter, with a honey-like tea and floral accompaniment. Some grasping tropical fruit flavours lose out to a pine resin overtone but strangely the usually super earthiness is kept at bay very nicely. A complex relationship is happening here and it reminds me of those old Bits n Bites commercial where no handful (mouthful) is the same. Feel: Slick and ‘oily’ middleweight. It feels so fluid and soft on the palate, the carbonation only giving nonchalant glances to the tastebuds as it all meanders by in a smooth and ethereal experience. Wow.Overall: Ahhh… this is what I like to see in an IPA. No wonder it is in our Top 100 Canada. Delicious and decadent, and surprisingly complex in its execution. Pairing : OMG… what do I put here. I didn’t intend to use this one for my Sunday Brunch, but I did so… keeping in the theme of brunch, how bout a delectable casserole - country chicken biscuits and gravy or a ham and cheese bake? A nice gourmet quiche would also suit this just fine. It definitely begs for a savoury partner. Given that it is only weeks away from Thanksgiving here in the great white north, I am willing to go so far as to suggest a pumpkin spice and pecan french toast - topped with some fresh apple, light syrup and powdered sugar! mmm…mmm…Sep 25, 2016', 'A:glowing Golden and effervescent (constant stream on micro bubblesS:Floral hop primary with a touch of tanginessT:lemon citrus notes very low bitternessM:a lingering feeling, coats the mouth almost creamyO: There is a reason this is a limited beer. it would be hard to compete with if it was available all the time.

Great beerSep 16, 2016', ""Look: whipped cream lacking in tenacity yet still pervasive in its whiteness and bubbles. Body is light copper and translucent.Smell: sesame seed and pepper coat pineapples, mandarin oranges and sharp mangoes. A hypnotic yeast and alcohol invigorates the edges of the aroma while tickling my nose and throat into a light giddiness. Dark syrups and resin wallow in the distant background from which purple bubble gum breezes ripple. When a puddle is left in the glass unacknowledged for a quarter of an hour its scent crumbles into cheese and sweat, which sounds unpleasant yet oddly isn't. Later neglected aromas are of ice and old festive candy and plums. Taste: A genuine replication of the aroma with the addition of amorphous perfume exhalations obscuring and infusing a long grapefruit bitter finish. Lemons and muted soaps greet the tongue. A toasted thin cracker studded with wild rice kernels corrals the experience. The long aftertaste eventually curls into tartness and grass. Feel: slick and oily; nothing harsh, prickly or abrasive.Sep 02, 2016"", 'Pours a very hazy orange body. Decent head with some lacing.

Fantastic - can\'t say enough - and going back to beer store tomorrow to buy their entire stock of Raised By Wolves IPA.Aug 25, 2015', ""Pours a pale gold with a soapy white head.

Mouthfeel is drying and bitter, body and carbonation are right on point.Overall, an absolutely delicious IPA.

Maybe a little late to the pumpkin craze for me, but the weather is looking a lot more early October-ish the past few days, so, um, there. Ironic, this, as I just tossed our two collapsed 'melting' pumpkins away.This beer pours a murky dark bronzed amber hue, with two fingers of creamy, foamy ecru head, which leaves some low iceberg, and spooky spectral profile lace around the glass as it readily bleeds away.It smells of gingerbread malt (with the preponderance of pumpkin beers nowadays, this must be valid), sharp nutmeg and metallic cinnamon spice, some further pastry-like sweetness, a soft vegetal pumpkin fleshiness, and a sugary, mild nuttiness. The taste is sweet nutty caramel malt, edgy clove and nutmeg, that further mixed-up savoury character that I usually get with allspice, an ethereal, given the other players, veritable pumpkin essence, and some floral, earthy hops.The carbonation is quite sedate, the body a sturdy medium weight, and agreeably smooth. It finishes on the sweet side, but just so - the lingering spices and heartwarming veggie character doing well to offset the latent and potent brown ale malt.A nice enough re-purposing of the fairly enjoyable base beer - I drink plenty of it on my annual guys' ski trip to Panorama. Though the spices may not be all that clear cut, who the hell cares - we've all had lots of cookies and pies with the same lovingly non-micromanaged doling out of the proscribed ingredients, so I'm more apt to just sit back in my chosen manner and savour the memory of another just-passed celebratory season.Nov 05, 2012"", ""Appearance - Pours a dark nutty brown with a finger width of bubbly, frothy head.Smell - Cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, pumpkin, malts, brown sugar.Taste - Starts with the pumpkin and pie spices, then followed with nutty flavours (I detect mostly hazelnut).

I didn\'t get much java (or hut, for that matter) at first whiff, more roasted malt and baker\'s chocolate than anything else. The overall flavor is a nice combination of the aforementioned elements - subtle coffee, dark chocolate, and just enough roasted malt to retain its ""stoutiness"", if that is a thing.

Suitably cozy mountain cabin imagery on the label.This beer pours a solid black, with varying basal orange-cola highlights, and two fingers of puffy, loosely foamy, and fairly bubbly brown head, which leaves a few instances of cannonball splash lace around the glass as it quickly blows off.It smells of gritty milk chocolate, soft cafe-au-lait bitter notes, lightly roasted caramel malt, a suggestion of earthy anise, and very plain leafy, weedy, and musty hops. The taste is bready caramel malt, a reduced bitter coffee grounds thing, medium dark cocoa powder, dusty black licorice notes, and more underwhelming leafy, earthy, and mildly herbal hoppiness.The bubbles are quite innocuous in their gentle and at times AWOL frothiness, the body a solid middleweight, and a bit too clammy to be deemed particularly smooth. It finishes off-dry, the coffee essence having bled off, and the chocolaty caramel left to fend a growing herbal and musty sideshow.Overall, not a bad coffee stout, in the sense that I prefer my java on the lower side of the intensity scale, if at all. I gotta say, though, that weird herbal astringency which starts off small, but spawns quickly into something more pervasive, doesn't do any of us any favours - in fact, if I were stuck with only this brew, in the location depicted on the label here, it might slowly drive me fucking insane.Jan 18, 2016""]",/beer/profile/3795/209023/

I am getting a slight apple-like fruitiness as well but nothing over the top as one might encounter in a micro-brewed light lager. Taste is sweet grains with just a small sharp edge, with the aforementioned hop notes translating nicely from nose to palate. Each sip starts sweet and ends dry and peppery. Some lemon character. Rather full-bodied, which might be fueling a biscuit-like vibe at times. Seems a hair more robust than otherwise similar brews. Nice mid-range carbonation.

It finishes just a touch off-dry, the inherent malt sweetness kind of stumbling around with its head down, and those same hop and spice notes circling for the kill.A rather tasty and enjoyable full-bodied pilsner, with the robust malt and sassy hops in spades. Add to that a pleasantly complex pepper spiciness, and we are good to go!

It finishes off-dry, but starting to think about trending towards the former, I suspect - lots of lingering malt and generic juicy citrus still abounding.Overall, the grapefruit character seems a lot more melded into the citrusy characteristics of the hops, than able to truly stand on its own, which is no biggie, really.

This had compared very favorably with Steamworks Flagship last year, but the current barnyard infection has dropped its score by 2 points. Giving it 3 points in the Overall category is a pity vote.Sep 01, 2019', ' oz bottle. Pours a hazy golden orange with a finger of puffy white head. Aroma of pineapple, mango, orange with some funky piney hops.

Funky, fresh and rustic with some tropical juice dipped bread to hold it together. It looks like Orval's punk grandkid in the glass. The aroma is a journey through textures of aroma and is a sweet lead-in to the dry flavor which also runs through a lot of elements (earthy, honey, fermented juice with mold starting to grow on it, etc.). To top it all off it feels like drinking carbonated reddi-whip. I realize that I seem like I am gushing, and that I might be overstating how good it is, but this really does hit a lot of high points all over the board. It's well put-together, balanced, funky, hoppy, the pils malt and oats is a REALLY nice touch and gives it some wonderful body that it otherwise might not have... I could go on. Suffice it to say it is fabulous, interesting, well-made, and was a pleasure to drink. Excellent beer! Grab it if you ever see it! (4.75)Aug 27, 2016"", 'Chilled bottle courtesy of Benjjjamin. Poured into tulip.Mildly aggressive head composed of larger bubbles. Dissipated over a couple of minutes to a leggy glass rimmer.Slightly hazy appearance with strong sunset orange hues. Smells of fresh stone fruits. Peaches and nectarines. So ripe Apple as well. Mild barnyard Brett straw/funk. Taste is similar. Peach is great but gives way to the funk of the Brett and the bitterness from the hops. All nicely blended flavour profile that commands another sip to delve deeper into nuances. Great beer. Could easily be a gateway beer Brett funk enjoyment zone. 4.20/5Jul 05, 2016', ""650 mL bottle obtained from the latest CANBIF - thanks Farees! Served lightly chilled.Pours a slightly hazy, medium gold colour, capped off with 1.5 fingers of creamy-looking foam. It dissipates steadily over the next couple of minutes, depositing a curtain of sponge print-patterned lacing as it recedes. A dense cap and generously-proportioned collar remain on top afterwards. Fruity hops on the nose; I'm getting mostly citrus, apricot and pineapple, with suggestions of mango, strawberry, pine resin, and Brett-derived funk.A very solid IPA; a modest backbone of doughy, bready pale malt and honey sweetness supports a big load of West Coast-style hoppage. Pine needles and resin come through with considerably more force than they did on the nose, in addition to notes of bitter grapefruit pith, apricot and pineapple. Subtly funky; it's noticeable, but Brett yeast flavours are definitely not the focus of the brew (at least, not until you get to the bottom fifth). Finishes with floral, grassy astringency that lingers on the palate. Fruity aftertaste with persistent hop bitterness. Medium in body, with light carbonation levels and a smooth, slick mouthfeel that coats the tongue after each sip. Final Grade: 4.23, an impressive A-. Juxtapose Wild IPA is almost a traditional West Coast IPA, but for one major twist - the Brett serves as a lovely complement to the piney, fruity hop bill. My only suggestion would be to amp up the Brett a little, because I am finding that the hops are kind of drowning out the funkier aspects of the flavour profile. Not a mind-blower, but I can understand how this one wormed its way onto the Canadian Top 100 - it's definitely a hophead pleaser, but with slightly more depth of flavour than your typical IPA. If you can find it, then try it!Jun 09, 2016"", 'On tap at The Alibi Room (30-May-16; #700/day 2) served in a 12 oz mug. Bright and complex with layers of fruit (melon, citrus), pine and mildly funky yeast. Lighter carbonation with a smooth mouthfeel.Jun 07, 2016', 'Pours a hazy cloudy gold with a thick white head with moderate retention. Smell is a combination of funk, lemon, mango, and apricot. Taste is the same with a touch of bitterness. All the flavors work well together. Moderate carbonation and mouthfeel. A very interesting beer.May 15, 2016', 'The ""wild"" part of Juxtapose Wild IPA manifests itself most obviously in the appearance; over-eager foam climbs up the glass as though it were running away from the bottle and the bottom portions come out looking like a combination of milk and sand. Still, this pulpy, opaque orange beer looks good.And it smells awesome! Brett enhances what was already an incredibly nectarous bouquet. Which qualities should be credited to the hops and which the yeast is a tough knot to entangle but this floral and ultra-fruity aroma is certainly, as the brewery put so elegantly, ""where orchards meet pastures"". Things get more intense on the palate; the tongue can appreciate bitter resins and barnyard-y earthiness not noticed by the nose. Still, Juxtapose tastes as though lemon and/or grapefruit juice was freshly squeezed into a chunky breakfast smoothie containing mango, pineapple, blood orange and yellow plum. Wild yeast adds a whole other dimension to the typical sunny, citrusy IPA - even if sourness isn\'t really part of it. Instead, it\'s notes of farmhouse notes of hay, orchard fruit skins and the zest of a thousand lemons (slight exaggeration) that breath extra life into those Columbus, Amarillo, and Simcoe hops. Not only are tropical hops and funky yeasts two of my favourite qualities, it also just so happens that they pair wonderfully together, each enhancing and complimenting the inherent characteristics of the other. Juxtapose Wild IPA is a beautifully crafted ale that I\'d want to have on-hand at all times.Mar 27, 2016', '650ml bottle poured into Sam Adams pint glass.Pours a slightly hazy golden yellow with four towering fingers of dense off-white head that leaves really cool lace as it recedes. Looks like patterns on handmade pottery.Smells of sweet melon, sliced limes, mild grainy malt, gentle yeast funk and lots of flowery, citrussy hops.Tastes of more whole grain bread caramel malt, limeade, mixed diced melons, bitter citrus rind, more gentle white cheese funk and more floral hops.Feels light and creamy. Medium-light bodied with smooth carbonation. Finishes off-dry.Verdict: Vigorously recommended. Four Winds appears to be the real deal.Mar 27, 2016', 'Appearance - Pours a straw gold with four fingers of frothy white head.Smell - citrus and leafy hops, bready caramel malts, yeast, citrus, hint of grapefruit.Taste - Citrus and leafy hops provide a nice punch in the start. The bready caramel malts, citrus, yeast, and bitter grapefruit peel help to finish the brew off.Mouthfeel - Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Finishes off dry with the yeast and hops lingering.Overall - An excellent rendition of the style. The aroma could use a little more oomph to it but otherwise a stellar example utilizing wild yeast and the citrus hop profile to its advantage.Mar 05, 2016', ""Oh my. I really wasn't sure what to expect, but this beer blew my mind. It is bright, complex, and full of melon flavors that I've never experienced in an IPA. I've heard plenty of hype surrounding Four Winds, and now I'm starting to get it. Juxtapose is an IPA that is light on the palate, accessible, and entirely enjoyable.Feb 28, 2016"", ""Easily one of the best BC IPAs that I've had and one of the best brett IPA I've had yet.

Enjoyed it much more in the middle/end given the bitter, dry finish. Feel - extremely smooth and creamyOverall - solid IPA. I think if anything my score being below average bight just be from me being a little tired of the style.Feb 22, 2016', ""50ml bottle - nice to see this Canadian whale make it to Alberta in something as ignominious as a mixed 4-pack of craft BC brews. Whatever, eh?This beer pours a slightly hazy, yet bright medium golden yellow colour, with a teeming tower of puffy, densely foamy, and moderately creamy off-white head, which leaves some chunky snow rime lace in places around the glass as it slowly but surely sinks away.It smells of bready and doughy caramel malt, mixed domestic citrus fruit, underripe cantaloupe and honeydew, understated funky yeast, a subtle white pepper and scallion spiciness, and further leafy, weedy, and spruce tip-like hop bitters. The taste is gritty, grainy, and mildly crackery caramel malt, a hint of biscuity toffee, semi-sweet blood orange, key lime, and Texas red grapefruit, a lessened generic melon fruitiness, still muddled, but hard to ignore common spices, some coyly funky yeastiness, a tame hard water flintiness, and more leafy, weedy, and piney hoppiness.The carbonation is fairly low-key in its gentle and caressing frothiness, the body a solid middleweight, and not so surprisingly smooth, after having read the brewing ingredient list on the label - those flaked oats really earn their keep! It finishes off-dry, the base pale and caramel-tinged malt holding steady, while the fruitiness and funk continue their lazy spin around the (metaphorical!) drain.Like Nectarous before it, I wasn't initially quite taken by the hype, but in the end, the beer in front of me more than made up for my sardonic lack of faith in hearsay. A stellar wild yeast-treated IPA, insofar as the guest baddies don't interfere with the complex fruity and varied green hoppy goodness on display here. Awesome stuff, and am I ever glad that I have another glass of this to enjoy in peace.Feb 04, 2016"", 'Got this one from Rutger this past summer. Your boxes always rule the world man. Cheers!

Clear safety orange with piles and piles of carbonation. Lots of it. Head slowly fades to a huge foamy cap and leaves lots of chunky lacing on the glass. A full cap remains and leaves lots of foamy lacing down the glass as it empties. SMELL: Lots of hops on this one. Tropical fruit, pine, melon, some lightly funky notes from the yeast, with some grass and hay as well. Citrus lemon and barnyard notes as well. Bold and enticing. Great. TASTE: Funky barnyard flavors up front with grassy, melon and citrus lemon flavors at the swallow. Nice, lingering finish of funk, tropical fruits, bitter pine flavors and lemon, citrus notes. Hoppy and fruity with some well measured funk from the wild yeast. Not overly sour, but plenty complex and balanced. Great stuff. PALATE: Medium body and carbonation. Very creamy on the palate, goes down smooth and finishes slightly dry. Some light bitterness lingers. Nice stuff here. OVERALL: This is really, really good and wonderfully refreshing.

Whipped head that leaves gobs of lacing is perfect. Aroma has slices of oranges mixed with a sweet and tart brett presence. The brett sets the tone for the flavor and gives way to lush fruit, mild tartness mixed with pine and peach fuzz. Very mellow but a nice lingering bitterness.May 31, 2014', 'Appearance is a muted tangerine orange with dense and stubborn head thanks to the bottle conditioning. Laces pretty well, though eventually it settles into a thick ring and film. Smell is pink grapefruit and honey - lots of sweet citrus, not much of the brettanomyces showing up at this point. Maybe just the slightest hint. Taste is a mix of more grapefruit citrus plus a light pine woodiness too. Underlying is a bed of acetic acid giving a clean, crisp, but gentle sourness to the body. No ""funk"" component that would probably bring down the bright citrus character anyway. Mouthfeel is crisp and lightly acidic with a very thin sappiness. Overall I\'m really, really pleased with this beer - the base IPA is wonderful and the brett\'s influence is subtle and only serves to benefit the base. The brett has a \'fresh\' taste to it, which is to say it doesn\'t add much in the way of complexity but it also keeps out of the bright and wonderful flavour\'s way too.Apr 09, 2014', 'A: Pours a golden apricot with 3 fingers of off-white head which quickly settles into a thin surface rim.

T: Underripe stone fruit, citrus, musk, grass and yeast in the mouth followeded by mild funk. M: a Medium bodied with light carbonation. O: A very enjoyable take on an IPA.

Touches even creamy notes of vanilla strangely in the mix. I am afraid to even drink this because I am convinced this can't be topped and it wont be better at this point… har har..The palate is still quite enjoyable, but seems only a slight let down from the nose, which is understandable. A very ight body, supportive enough, but missing a bit of edge to push this wild into exceptional territory. Still the palate hits solidly with good tropical guava, passion fruit, and mango flavors. Real light bodied and comes off more mimosa and slightly flat champagne in feel, but gives excellent fruit character to the palate. Doesn't quite hint of souring, strangely, as it seems to have really mellowed out in acidity and funk, but in a nice way.I am pretty certain that this is quite a few months old in the can, but seeing that this is so highly rated there was no way I could pass it up for trying.

A minute stream of carbonation cascades up the sides of the glass, feeding a (initially) big, fluffy, soapy, off-white head of multi-sized bubbles. That head drops to a bubbly film quite quickly, with odd spots of lacing down the glass. Quite pretty for a wild ale, and the hazy glow adds to the attractiveness.Delicate but really lovely nose, with both sweet and sour/tart notes: lemon, nectarine, passionfruit, wine grapes, granny smith apple, under-ripe pineapple, damp green grass, juicy orange, peach, pear, and a slight horsey funk. Quite floral, thinking honeysuckle and rose pedals, with a little peppery spice. Really, really wonderful with its nuance, layers, and complimentary components. Absolutely digging the aroma profile, which remains true to the wild/sour category while introducing some nice (but not overpowering) IPA characteristics.Heavy wine and cider influence on the tongue, with a very nice balance of tartness and fruity sweentess, plus a little Brett-like bite. Grapefruit pith, lime zest, under-ripe pineapple and peach, nectarine skin, passionfruit, dry Chardonnay, starchy greens, and yeast roll. Slightly puckering and prickly on the tongue, but finishes extremely dry and clean with a lingering note of sour green apple and lemon. It both is and isn't sour, which is quite interesting. There's also a note of salinity in the background. I'm not loving the taste profile quite as much as the remarkable aroma profile, but it's still very tasty and extremely drinkable.Light but soft feel, nicely carbonated with a wonderful prickle, plus a nice coating aspect on the teeth and throat. There's residual citrus and pith on the teeth that provides a nice juicy kick in the aftermath.This one comes with some pretty high marks by BA reviewers, but it largely lives up to the billing. Really outstanding beer that I would absolutely seek out again.Feb 26, 2020"", 'Hazy pineapple juice with no visible carbonation and 4 fingers of glassy white head.Smells of nectarines and fresh green herbs, pineapple and candy.Bone dry sour of passionfruit, pineapple and dank green herb.Light body with champagne carbonation.

A bit of barnyard kicks in at the end.Low carbonation level, so it doesn't foam up much. Somewhat astringent.My notes on this beer from a year ago make no mention of the barnyard smell and flavor. It is fairly low level, but I have been hypersensitized by all the local beer that tastes of nothing but barnyard this year. I would be much happier if the barnyard was knocked down by an order of magnitude. This has lost more than a full point in the score from last year.

Despite dissipating rather quickly, it does leave a decent surface and lacing ring with a few chunky surface deposits.Aromatics: Some glorious tropical sour funk.

Plenty of sweet nectars (nectarine and apricot) and sugars filling out the orchestra in the background.Taste: Ooowee zinger sour kick right off the bat. The tropical fruitiness really showing through with a slightly subdued lemon zing and vibrant pineapple and stone fruits filling out the entry form and jamming it in the raffle box. There is a very odd complexity in the flavour mix, the sour doing a wonderful job of keeping the tastebuds in a frenzy as the sweet flavours wash over the palate.Feel: Tart, zesty and bright with a medium body and enough carbonation to keep things upbeat and festive. Superb clean finish.Overall: One of the best sours I’ve had. It’s aromatic notes really doing justice to the flavour and the mouthfeel.Pairing : A wonderful sour that I think could use further supports as opposed to trying to counter.

Served slightly chilled.Pours a cloudy golden-blonde colour, with one finger of dense, creamy, highly resilient white head seated atop; it retains cohesion for a period of time exceeding fifteen minutes. Excellent lacing, with a thick, lumpy, foamy cap and collar. Juicy notes of fuzzy peach, mango, passion fruit, white grape, papaya, bubble gum and mandarin orange make themselves well-known on the nose. Lighter notes of funky acidity and grainy, bready pale malt sweetness. Very enticing aroma; certainly one of the most tempting that I can recall. Totally delicious; fruity, sour, tart and tangy. Subtle, grainy pale malt sweetness is immediately obliterated by flavours of sour peach, juicy nectarine, mango, passion fruit and tangerine. Orange rind, lemon zest and lingering tropical fruit flavours remain prominent through the finish, distracting from sour notes that give the aftertaste a tart feel. Very little funk to speak of; it\'s mostly just tropical/orchard fruit and sharp acidity - but oh man, is that a fabulous combo. The lemony tartness and lactic acid intensify after the second pour, concentrating the ""wildness"" of this beer, if you will. Light in body, with middling carbonation levels that provide the palate with a gentle jolt of prickly bubbles. Not particularly crisp, which is what I was expecting - the mouthfeel has a softer, frothier feel to it, but it\'s still extremely refreshing nonetheless.Final Grade: 4.63, a near-flawless A+. Nectarous is hands-down one of the best soured ales that I\'ve had the good fortune to try, at least to date. Thanks again, Farees! This one\'s flavour abounds with notes of juicy, tart stone fruit and tropical fruit, which act as an exceedingly effective counterpoint to the wild bug acidity that wraps the profile up cleanly.

Muchas gracias once again to rogerdandy for setting me up with another potentially stellar BC offering.This beer pours a hazy, pale golden straw colour, with four fingers of puffy, finely foamy, and rather fizzy off-white head, which leaves a few instances of cannonball splash lace around the glass as it slowly and evenly abates. Lots of rising effervescence, as well.It smells of peppy orchard stone fruit - peach and nectarine, sure, but also underripe white grapes, lemon, and some pineapple core - a subtly milky sourness, softly bready and grainy pale malt, a bit of white cooking vinegar, faint pepper-like spice, and some tame musty, earthy bitterness. The taste is sharp, tart fruit anew, the nectarine, white peach, apricot, grape skins, lemon, and pineapple all mixing and mingling to great aplomb, while the grainy, lightly crackery malt stands at the ready, scanning the room for trouble, a meek sour milk thing hugs the walls, and some apple vinegar astringency bristles at getting its ID checked.The carbonation is quite active in its frothy and fizzy meanderings, but thankfully doesn't overfill my mouth - a typically unwelcome trait of these sorts of beers - the body an adequate medium weight, and generally smooth, a simple airy creaminess arising over time. It finishes off-dry, just, as the lingering fruitiness keeps the lurking (but good) beasties from fully bleeding this one, um, dry.A preposterously well-made sour beer, the balance achieved with the still over-the-top fruit character is remarkable. And no actual fruit added, it would seem (I first thought that I still had some juice on my hands from cleaning my toddler's face after he assaulted a nectarine earlier). Sheesh, this is so good, and that from a usually less than enthusiastic follower of the style.Aug 26, 2015"", 'This beer is simply phenomenal.

It smells of bready and doughy cereal malt, some mild domestic citrus rind, a faint earthy yeastiness, and more leafy, weedy, and piney green hop bitters.

I better jot down a few notes now before it's too late! This dense copper tone, though perfectly clear, certainly places it on the darker end of the style's spectrum, at least in terms of a modern 'American-style' example. There's arguably no more classic duo than Cascade and Centennial. That blend of juicy fresh fruit and sappy pine tree resin is a personal favourite of mine, and the majority of craft beer consumers. These are the components that define the style; they aught to give it away in a blind tasting. While I'm not crazy about an excess of malt in pale ales, this combination of munich, cara pils, and crystal provides a crunchy base with toasty, nutty undertones that, in contrasting the bitter grapefruit pith and herbal resin notes, actually serves to accentuate and compliment them perfectly. And while it's the nougat and toffee brittle that the nodes in the pleasure center of my brain keep drooling over, in actuality, this beer is really defined by the citrus coursing through its veins. The aftertaste is comprised almost exclusively of whole (skin included) oranges, grapefruit and mangoes. Four Winds Pale Ale has big confidence yet balance. The presence of hops far outweigh the measly 38 IBU they've been credited, and there's also a delicious amount of maltiness crammed in considering how much of the palate those tropical, herbal notes occupy. It's just incredibly good.Mar 04, 2016"", 'A great hop-forward pale ale, great NW hop aroma and flavour (cascade and centennial) with a nice malt body to balance it out.

I have a good dozen sours under my belt now, and they definitely range from “just bit into a lemon” to “meh, more tangy than sour”… this is in the former - It does have a good kick at the sour can. I love things sour and/or spicy so when it makes me pucker and smack my palate on the first sip it’s pretty decent, if I squint too then its really good, this was close to almost squinting. Of course you get used to it after a bit so it lessens each sip. But sour it does have - now other flavours I get include a decent lemon/lime citrus and red plum is there. I know, because I just picked one off my tree and had a bite after the first few sips for comparison. It is tart and tangy as well, but the sour is more prominent than those. There is also subtle flavours of peach and cherry in there, and maybe a tad of sweetened wheatgrass.Feel: Good middle-of-the road body, lightly carbonated and buttery smooth. Finish is fairly expedited leaving a slight yeasty-fruit flavour to linger.Overall: I think a fairly good sour. If it makes me pucker, I’ll like it. Good fruit choice(s) in the flavour profile. I enjoy most of Fugggles’ fruit explorations - I think I like this one so far most. They usually fall short, they promise you some sort of fruity experience and it seems to come up short (Strawberry Wit, I’m looking at you…) But all-in-all this is pretty good for a kettle sour, so I recommend it.Pairing : I’m going aesthetics here - they were going for a Japanese or Asian theme so I’m going to go with a couple Asian suggestions. Though I believe most sushi will go great with this beer, I think I would enjoy a good firecracker chicken (this is probably a North America thing - but spicy hot chicken instead of a fish protein), a roll of tomago (sweet egg) would be fantastic, really balance out that sour. And of course plenty of sweet tempura sauce for dipping. On the warmer side of things, a really good gyoza (by good I mean stuffed with chicken+pork+vegetable).

The taste is somewhat tart black plums, bready and grainy pale malt, understated yeast, a muddled earthy spiciness, some sour lactic essences, and more unheralded leafy, weedy, and floral hop bitterness.The carbonation is average in its palate-probing frothiness, the body a solid medium weight, and mostly smooth, with a wee airy creaminess wondering if it will ever get permission to land. It finishes off-dry, both the understated plum and lingering malt trying to make a game of it, as such.Overall, this is a rather commendable attempt at a fruity sour ale, as the plums in question exhibit both the yin and the yang of their inherent kind, which makes for a very enjoyable and engaging kettle sour ale experience. Worthy of trying out, even if the label makes your eyes hurt.Aug 15, 2016']",/beer/profile/41118/229889/

Head was a tan color with mostly fine bubbles. The head quickly dropped down to a thin skiff but did not leave any lacing. Couldn't see any bubbles rising.Smells of hops, mild sweet florals, light malt, and a bit of barnyard which faded. Swirling the glass kicked up the barnyard again and something a little minty.Flavor of some darker malts and hops, with a medium-high bitter level. The hops and bitters pop out in the aftertaste. Much milder flavor than I expected. The rye didn't stand out. Thankfully the barnyard scent didn't show up in the taste.Low carbonation, but it did foam up into some larger bubbles. Medium-heavy body.Generally this tastes like an average IPA with a more roasted malt. Doesn't seem all that relevant for the winter season, as it could fit in well with the summer IPAs.Jan 09, 2020"", ""50ml bottle, part of this brewery's apparent 'kisetsu' series, which means 'season' in Japanese. Ok, then. Also, rye is not in the list of ingredients on the label, strangely.This beer pours a clear, very dark brown colour, with nuanced cola highlights, and one fat finger of puffy, finely foamy, and mildly bubbly tan head, which leaves some approaching thunderstorm lace around the glass as things slowly subside.It smells of strong, if mixed fruity notes - orange and grapefruit, sure, but with additional juicy tropicals - earthy yeast, grainy and lightly roasted pale and caramel malt, a twinge of that phenolic band-aid thing, some bittersweet cocoa, and further green leafy, weedy, and resinous pine hop bitters. The taste is big and fruity up front - sort of a blend between domestic citrus and more heady Mediterranean dark figs and the like - with some generic toasted caramel and wanly spicy wheat malt, a retreating edgy yeastiness, faded stale chocolate, and more weak herbal, leafy, and piney hoppiness.The bubbles are pretty laid-back in their plainly lounging frothiness, the body an adequate medium weight, and kind of clammy in its attempt at any kind of smoothness. It finishes well off-dry, the fruity and malty characters starting to run off with it.Definitely a fruity affair, with the bittering counter agents barely holding up their end of the tacit bargain. The roast blows off fairly quickly, the purported rye seems to merely exist in the title, and that weird yeastiness lends credence only to the overall Japanese-influenced brewing perception here.Feb 24, 2016"", '.4% abv, 75 ibu, 650ml bottle.A - dark redish brown with light brown head, lacing.S - fruity, citrus, spice, chocolate, dried date, fig, longan, raisin tartness, roasted malt, brown sugar.T - well carbonated, medium body, complex, not as refreshing as regular ipa, sweet upfront, rye spice, dark malt chocolate & coffee characters came out, balanced out with long lasting bitterness. O - great brew offered by F&W, interesting favors, yet complex. like porter with citrus (refreshing fruit) and the high bitterness. keeping beer weird! and indeed! weird but delish!Feb 22, 2016', ""I picked this up because I was fascinated by the name, though I do like darker IPAs. This beer pours black and without lustre. About one finger of tan head kicks up and slowly retreats to the edges, leaving small archipelagos of foam behind. The smell is rich, but difficult to place. Roasted malt and pine dominate the first impressions. Though I like dark beer, I found this to be almost scorched - I thought of burned toast many times while finishing it off. This one leaves a resinous hop aftertaste, so if that's your thing, enjoy!Feb 21, 2016""]",/beer/profile/41118/215468/

Slightly astringent.Very light touch of strawberry over the wit base. Like a strawberry shortcake. The only negative is the appearance. The color is a little odd.

The taste is more strawberry, but in a crisp, background manner, with an ascendant doughy, bready wheat and caramel malt, middling yeast, a suggestion of coriander/white pepper spice, soft, sweet milky notes, and a plain earthy, grassy bitterness that may or may not be borne of hops.The carbonation is nice and light in its playful and engaging frothiness, the body a so-so middleweight for the style, and quite smooth, with a gentle creaminess politely putting up its hand right after the get-go. It finishes off-dry, the lactose component starting to nudge out the heretofore dominant strawberry and grainy wheatiness.A tasty and interesting fruit beer, the attempt at a strawberries & cream flavoured witbier more or less working out. Not too tart, not too sweet, but just about right, its refreshing qualities still relevant as August ticks over into September, and yet summer persists, sunshine and verdant grass alike.Sep 01, 2015', ""Pours a vibrant orangeish golden colour. A big burst of strawberries and cream on the nose, a hint of wheatiness and a little lemon zest, really nice. Taste falls more towards your typical witbier; the strawberry isn't nearly as prominent here, much more of an grassy/herbal quality, just a touch medicinal. Mouthfeel is on the thin side, dry too.Love that F&W went for something new here. While it's the not the most complex, it'd certainly make an excellent gateway beer for those new to the craft beer world.Jul 27, 2015"", 'Appearance - pours a hazy straw gold with a finger of bubbly white head.Smell - immediately hit with fresh strawberries, Belgian yeast, grassy hops, bready malts, wheat.Taste - starts off with Belgian yeast and wheat malt flavours, along with he sweetness of lactose and tartness of strawberries, which has a lingering quality.Mouthfeel - medium bodied with light to moderate carbonation.

Sigh.This beer pours a clear, bright medium golden yellow colour, with four fingers of puffy, loosely foamy, and fizzy dirty white head, which leaves a few instances of hovering invading spacecraft lace around the glass as it quickly blows off.It smells of weak grainy pale malt, pithy corn grits, a bit of musty yeastiness, apples that have been in the fridge for way too long, and a bit of weedy and dead grassy green hop bitters. The taste is semi-sweet, grainy and bready pale malt, corn sugar, stale apple juice, a lesser wayward son yeasty character, and more musty, weedy, and estery floral 'verdant' hoppiness.The carbonation is fairly active in its genteel frothiness, the body a decent middleweight, and generally smooth, with a wee airy creaminess sitting on the sidelines, waiting for the call to jump into the game. It finishes well off-dry, the mixed cheap malt and touched fruitiness the order of the day.Overall, this is just another plain domestic lager in the vein of Big Surf/Bone Beer/whatever, one which will quickly fade into obscurity, I imagine.

I'd give this beer a B-Mar 06, 2020"", 'Clear red-brown color. Head formed of medium sized bubbles and quickly dropped down to a thin skiff. No lacing. High flux of small bubbles rising from the bottom keeping the minimal skiff of head replenished.Very sweet smell blended from caramel, marshmallow, and some floral/herbal scents that seem more familiar in a soft drink like a coke. Swirling the glass kicked up cherry and chocolate scents as if a black forest cake had gone into the mash.Tastes like a thin black forest cake, with sweet cherries and some mild chocolate. The caramel malt joins in a mid-taste. The aftertaste is of a slightly bitter chocolate that has been baked a bit.Some tongue tingling for a while as it builds to a large bubbled foam. The foam ends up feeling like a medium heavy body.Interesting scent and flavor. This should probably appeal more to the chocolate lovers. I would have enjoyed it more if there had been more caramel malt and less chocolate.Nov 05, 2019', 'Happy CANada Day, hosers! Take off, eh? This is one of my FAVORITE holidays of the year since it provides me with the impetus to a) drink CANned CANadian beer ISO The CANQuest (tm); b) watch hockey (either pre-recorded games or movies, like ""Slapshot""; c) watch ""Strange Brew""; d) eat some beaver & e) parade nekkid in the street while waving a CANdian flag. 2017 was their 150th Anniversary so I pulled out all of the stops, using sparklers & firecrackers as accoutrements, which was attention-getting, to say the least. The local CANstabulary was bemused & amused as they led me away, but I was less-than-thrilled with the 1st & 2nd degree burns, especially to my sensitive bits! Needless to say, I have scaled back since then. This will be my last for the holiday since having drank extensively of Ontario & some of Quebec, now it is British Columbia\'s turn!A BIG ""THANK YOU!"" to my local, in-person trading partner, @tone77 , for providing me with a buncha beers for today\'s CANebration! He said that many of them will take me back to the early days of The CANQuest (tm), when AALs were the standard & the norm. No matter! Today, we CANebrate & inebriate! Cheers to our CANuck neighbors! From the CAN: ""This winter warmer features robust notes of cocoa, caramel and vanilla. So get out of the cold and into the bold. It\'s good to be here (R)."" I had ""Rush\'s Greatest Hits"" playing on YouTube as I Crack!ed open the vent to begin this momentous CANebration. I went with a slow, gentle C-Line Glug on this one, having just awakened from a late-evening nap. I watched in rapt fascination as it billowed into two-plus fingers of dense, foamy, rocky, deep-tan/light-brown head with moderate retention. Color was a gorgeous Coppery-Brown (SRM = > 17, < 22) with CANadian-quality clarity. Nose smelled like a liquefied chocolate cookie with notes of chocolate and vanilla with a bready, doughy sweetness. Mmm. Mouthfeel was medium. The taste was VERY chocolaty & quite sweet with an inherent doughiness. It was closer to cookie dough than an actual cookie. Finish remained sweet & chocolaty. I was less-than-enthused, but only because sweet does not do it for me. YMMV.Jul 02, 2019', 'Poured from a 16 oz. can. Has a bronze color with a 1 inch head. Smell is of cocoa, malts.

I had a 6 pack from bottle, and one of a few that I had at room temperature tasted really nutty. I'm not sure why the others didn't. Sometimes it depends what you've eaten, but usually I don't eat anything before tasting beer (even hours), and just drink water.Edit: Originally I tried it in a can, and now I tried it in bottle. Bottle seems a fair bit worse; I'm surprised that there's such a difference. Seems more watery, less flavorful. Could just be my perception though. The following review is only for the can.Smells fantastic. I've had a couple other beers with this smell. Smells strongly of chocolate —liquor chocolates in particular— and some vanilla or cream soda smell as well. A bit of other typical beer smell perhaps, too, but mostly just the previous two.Carbonation is medium high, and quite fine and not coarse. I like the mouthfeel.Taste: Chocolate, vanilla (possibly a somewhat artificial vanilla? It reminds me of cream soda, granted cream soda is vanilla-flavored as well) are the most prominent. However, I can also notice a nice bit hops later on as it finishes, as well as occasionally some roasted taste. Overall the flavors are very well balanced in my opinion. Oh yes, and lastly it definitely tastes very sweet for a beer. I rather like that, especially for something that has chocolate and vanilla.If I recall correctly, it reminds me of Waterloo Brown Ale with vanilla and chocolate flavors added to it. That was another sweet beer, but it didn't have as varied flavors as this, with most of it being roasted malt.Overall I really love this beer. It's like a liquid desert — and while I've heard people describe beers like that before, this would be the first time I'd definitely or easily agree with them, more than any other beer I've had. Do note though that while I love it, if you don't like sweetness, or prefer prominent hops flavor, this probably isn't for you.Feb 28, 2016"", 'Granville Island Lions Winter Ale Look: Dark brown medium carbonationSmell: chocolate malts vanilla and a touch of mint maybeTaste: Chocolate, vanilla, mint.Feels: mild carbonationSo overall would I recommend it?

Decent, carbonation-heavy head that recedes fairly quickly to a few islands. Smell is cocoa powder (like hot chocolate mix?), artificial vanilla, caramel malt, chocolate malt? Chocolate milk syrup? And the taste echoes most of those notes, even down to the almost gritty, chocolate-powder-like flavour. Some dark cherry notes? The vanilla feels a bit off, here, somehow synthetic? And the whole affair is rather sweet. Body is light--almost too light, and yet it feels heavy in its sweetness and artificiality.A mixed bag.

This rather sweet brew looks the part of a winter beer, a pleasing dark red amber to brown with around an inch of tan head. Looks like a classic English porter. Does not taste like a classic English porter. Smells like milk chocolate and vanilla, a candy bar in a pint glass. Tastes much the same, milk chocolate, vanilla, carob, caramel, and a nutty flavor a bit like pecans. I get some red fruit and raisin or plum notes as well. I often enjoy this sort of ""dessert beer"" but unfortunately this one became cloying and unpleasant about halfway through a pint. Mouthfeel is nice and creamy but the body is a little too light and crisp for what should be a sipper. Has the body of a session ale but tastes a lot darker and sweeter than any such beer. There are some flaws, including an unpleasant saccharine sweetness that does not taste natural (despite the fact that all-natural ingredients are used), what seems like oxidation manifesting as wet cardboard, and an odd melding of leafy aromatic flavors with the dark malts to produce a mint chocolate chip vibe that became way too dominant on the palate; it was all I could taste after a while. Not sure what the fix would be ... Perhaps less emphasis on the spice/flavoring component so that the malts can do the work of making things rich and chocolatey without the need for so many sweet tooth histrionics.Nov 24, 2013', ""Actually a fairly interesting brew built around a very nice malt backbone.

It starts with caramel malt mixed with molasses and brown sugar that turns more herbal as candy cane mint, cinnamon and vanilla notes come out and then fade away. It's just so overwhelmingly sweet...I'm almost inclined to think of it more like a liquor then a beer.Mouthfeel: The carbonation is very low, and I think it's absence is what is letting some of the sweeter elements run wild here.

It demonstrates flawless clarity, decent froth and is rich with gleaming highlights. You'd sell a lot of magazines with this on the cover! A bit quiet initially, the aromas of vanilla and creamy caramel build effortlessly once they've had a chance to properly breathe. A dash of carob and pecan-like nuttiness also grows on you, as does the faintest whiffs of waffle and bittersweet Belgian chocolate. These sweet, universally appealing scents make a very friendly introduction. The vanilla flavouring is hardly creamy or candy-sweet - it tastes like vanilla pod not vanilla cupcake. Still, the beer feels a bit artificial. The toffee and creamy caramel notes aren't the subtler, nuanced type typically suggested by specialty malts - they are the kind you get in a store-bought cake. The flavours are rather buoyant and very toothsome, which isn't bad...though it must be said that there is hardly a palpable taste of winter in this 'winter ale'. Christmas, maybe, because of a carob/nutmeg-like spice. But winter? This doesn't quite have the body, strength or makeup to match the harsh realities of a (non-Pacific) Canadian winter. British Columbia's Lions Winter Ale is kind of a reflection of where it's brewed.

Granville Island's Lions Winter Ale is a highly quaffable, enjoyable little warmer in its own right, but what it comes down to is this - if someone gave this to me blindfolded, I seriously might mistake it for Vanilla Coke or cream soda, and for that reason I really can't take it seriously. This isn't the greatest winter beer in the world, but it's still a charming brew with far more drinkability than the average warmer. Of the Granville brews I've tried, this is easily the best and probably the only one I would seriously consider recommending to others, or re-purchasing.Dec 24, 2012"", 'Lets start by saying that I agree with JohnnyBarman on the can advertising.

Taste a bit like pancakes with loads of vanilla in it. M: Thin and a bit watery, good carbonation, great bitterness to malt, finishes with a bit of sweetnessO: This is something great for the holidays. I wish it had more body and perhaps a bit more bread/biscuit flavours to it. Or even batter, some smokiness to it. But those are only my opinions. This is going well with fruit cake.Dec 21, 2012', 'Amber/copper colour, one finger of dense white head, good amount of lace here as well too. Smell is a nice mix of vanilla and spices, caramel, toffee, a subtle roast malt profile as well as some chocolate present. Taste is spicy and lightly sweet, vanilla with bits of toffee, chocolate and roast were more pleasant on the nose than on the palate, bit of bready flavours with a light bitterness. Medium carbonation, light to medium body. Not a bad beer and something I apreciate compared to some other spice bomb winter ales, a bit lackluster however but still a good drink.Dec 17, 2012', ""Can from the LCBO. I remember having this beer about four years ago, and thinking that it was an extremely vanilla-tasting brew. Looking forward to revisiting this. Can label is pretty uninspired, I have to say, compared to the nice bottle, but what can you do.Poured into a nonic glass. Dark amber-brown, bit of ruby around the edges. Nice creamy head of foam, good retention. Lots of icicle lacing as well. Kept up well in the can.Nose is certainly vanilla-heavy, so that much has remained the same. Caramel, bit of chocolate, a few odd christmas seasonings, but vanilla sweetness rules the day. Again, vanilla is this brew's strong suit, but it has a few other cards in hand to play. There is some hop bitterness in there, as well as a decent malt backing with some cracker and biscuit. Actually, quite surprised with this. A bit watery in flavour, but quite easy to drink. Nice break from all the clove/coriander/molasses heavy winter brews I've had recently. Watery feel, slightly creamy, moderate carbonation.I have to say I did like this brew, which is a surprise for me with Granville. I happen to like vanilla a great deal, so that helped, but in general it was more balanced than I thought it would be.Dec 16, 2012"", ""Dark amber in colour, a bit of a caramel hue. A very small off-white head disappears almost instantly. The nose is filled with vanilla, almost overwhelming. Behaind that, caramel malt, cocoa, hazelnut. Smells very sweet, candy like. The vanilla smells like it is probably extract or artificial- does not seem like actual vanilla bean.The vanilla is also prominent in the taste, which is no surprise. Coupled with caramel and hazelnut, as well as some spices. Quite sweet. Finish is a bit metallic, artificial. Beer is quite thin, strongly carbonated. Rather insubstantial, particularly for the flavours. Overall, decent, but not something I would want often. I am a big vanilla fan, which probably helped, but I don't think it is done particularly well in this beer.Apr 19, 2012"", ""Bottle shared by Steve, 341ml into a tulip. Golden brown in colour, offwhite head - only a ring of retention persists, no lacing. Nose is full of vanilla, perhaps slightly artificial in tone. Some cocoa, brown sugar and nuts as well. Taste is lightly nutty, more breadiness, caramel, cocoa and vanilla. Carbonation is a bit higher than I'd like, but a few swirls of the glass took it down to a manageable level. Fairly thin however, and perhaps a little too sweet in the finish. Nose is quite nice, but palate doesn't live up to it.

The head reduces to a thin skiff of foam that leaves some small patches of lacing.S - Not at all what I remember. Tons of sweet malty goodness upfront, with strong vanilla, maple, toffee, and nut notes. Quite woody, maybe oak, with some smokey tones as well. I just can't get over how sweet and rich this smells. Almost reminds me of Rogues Hazelnut Brown Nectar, but with some of the nutty aromas replaced with vanilla and toffee. T - A malt bomb for sure. Piles of caramel malt, vanilla sweetness and toffee notes dominate upfront. The woody character is subdued but still detectable, coming through along with the nuttiness and smokey/light roastiness. Finishes with a touch of holiday spices and more lingering vanilla extract sweetness. Very well put together if you don't mind sweet, malty beer.M - Feels a touch on the lighter side, but the fine carbonation that thoroughly fills the body gives it a nice feel overall.D - Pretty good stuff, and certainly a better brew than my memory had me believe.

Would definitely buy again.Dec 03, 2011', ""Ahh, a Christmas classic in the Vancouver area. This was my first winter warmer and still among my favourites. When I was first of age, as far as beer is concerned, this beer defined what Christmas was supposed to taste like. The really striking aspect of this beer is the vanilla flavours that go all the way through, from the initial smell to the lingering aftertaste. I would definitely recommend this to anyone that appreciates beer with that sweet vanilla taste; it's so very drinkable.Another similar one to this in BC is Tree Brewing's Vertical Winter Ale; I think it's even better, though GI's Lions Winter Ale is still excellent. Try 'em both and support your BC breweries this Christmas!Cheers!Nov 26, 2011"", 'I`ve had this beer multiple times, and thought it would be a good beer for my first review.Appearance - Pleasant, not much head at all, less than a finger.

There`s a bitter note there as well.Mouthfeel - Medium amounts of carbonation, and a crisp and clear, slightly bitter feel.Overall - Very drinkable. The vanilla is really the key here, it is what makes it as palatable as it is. I most likely will order again next time I am at the pub that offers this beer, seeing as it`s the best one on tap. I will order it soon, especially if I am having a dessert.Nov 17, 2011', ""I love this beer. As far as I'm concerned it is the best tasting local beer in Vancouver. It reminds me of Unibroue beers from Quebec, which is high praise.

Usually Canadian micros leave me a bit wanting. Not so for this brew. It was served at Snowshoe Sam\'s at Big White ski area and drawn from a tap that was labeled ""Granville Island Winter Ale"" A wonderful reddish copper color but the head faded quickly. The malt aroma was predominant really no hops were noticed. I found the flavour very surprising, the malt just jumped out and grabbed my palate. The hops were so far in the background I didn\'t detect them at first. All in all a very caramel taste that just seemed right for my liking. After the first pint I had a few plates of various flavoured chicken wings but the malt just kept right up with the various types of wings. A dense body best describes the mouthfeel. I could have certainly had a few more if my much better half said it was time to head back to our condo. I\'ll certainly try this beer again and againJan 24, 2007', 'This beer confuses me a little bit. In previous years, before I was really into craft beer, this would be my pride and joy during the winter season. The heavy spice flavors combined with the vanilla finish were unique to me at that point and seemed unfathomable in other beers.Well my perceptions have changed slightly. Appearance: The beer pours a beautiful colour. Dark amber with a finger\'s head.Smell: Delicious. The aroma on this beer never ceases to impress me. Lots of clove and vanilla. Overall, a ""sweet"" aroma.Taste: This is where the beer falls short of my memories. It seems somewhat cloying. The flavours are unrefined. They are all there but not as blended as I would prefer. Bold vanilla dominates the taste. The first bottle of the sixer tasted rather metallic and artificially chemically. I figured it was still young(The beer was just released 2 days earlier) so I left it in the fridge for a couple weeks. The next ones I tried seemed to be better so maybe I had a bad bottle.Mouthfeel: This is a lighter beer overall, especially for a supposed winter warmer. Good carbonation level...Not too much, not too little. A little watery.Drinkability: I can drink this like water. Alcohol is relatively low so it\'s not overly aggressive in aroma or taste and the vanilla flavour is different enough to make you want to keep drinking it. It\'s a good conversation beer as everyone around you can smell the vanilla and spice notes in the aroma. I got my cousin\'s boyfriend hooked on this stuff last year so it\'s obviously drinkable to craft beer geek and everyone else in between.Overall: I give it a high rating because I have enjoyed it previosuly for the past 2 years before I was into craft beer. Now that I have some more experience, I\'ll say that it is a very average beer that serves it\'s purpose during the holiday season. I\'ll still buy it because it\'s so drinkable but for a treat I\'ll take a Granville Island Merry Monks or a Tree Spiced Mid-Winter Ale.This beer is definately NOT retired.

On a cold evening, theres nothing quite like a Granville Island Lions Winter Ale. It warms you nicely, and your first taste leaves your mind wandering as to what ingredients make up this aromatic ale. Although, it's flavored with vanilla, I'm led to believe that its actually made up of something a little more nutty.Nutmeg like. This is the one thing I miss most about winters in Vancouver.To experience this ale to its full capacity, i really would suggest visiting the Granville Island Brewery, on a winters day, taking up a window seat, and admiring the snow fall as you kick your feet back, and just enjoy that holiday aroma as the smooth ale does exactly what its supposed to.If you prefer darker ales: Guiness, Newcastle Brown, and most winter ales, you'll love this one.Indy :o)Dec 04, 2005"", 'This is the 2005 version and I must say that the often overpowering vanilla notes are moved to the back.

There's some nice balance going on here. The color is a nice light amber and the head is not too thin. The first few sips are a taste experience and then you get used to it and appreciate the subtle hoppiness and flavor. Well worth a look for, but I'm not sure if you can get it in a six pack on its own.

Buttery, definite maple syrup, dark candied malt, some grainy tree-bark, even pine aromas. Nuts, and root beer. A definite pop smell to it. Cinammon and tree resin. The bottle itself states there is vanilla in the taste and aroma, and it is true: vanilla is extremely evident in the taste. Almost precisely this beer resembles the aroma. There is a decent hop dryness, but a finish of cardboard or wood, which leaves a dry feeling. I dislike the finish. It is a little cloyingly syrupy on the tongue; a little lacking in balance somehow. Predominantly malty brew. This beer starts off nicely with a fruity-sweet smell, and a vanilla taste up front, but there is an undesirable feeling left in the mouth, almost as if this beer has been stored improperly.Dec 11, 2004', ""Pours a reddish brown with almost nothing for head despite an aggressive pour.

Thin fizzle of beige head with little retention. Things pick up on the aroma, dense caramel malt, chocolate wafers rounded out with vanilla bean, very appealing. The flavour starts out a little thin, light grainy malt, but starts picking up momentum in the middle. That malty wafer flavour appears, along with the dry cocao, which carries to the finish where there is some slight vanilla waiting to join the party. The mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side, but I've taken this to be the standard that Granville Island aims for. The texture of the finish is rather quite dry and wafery, which I find unique for a winter ale, but I like it.

Another solid seasonal from Granville Island!Jun 04, 2010', ""Sampled on tap at the Granville Brewpub as their current seasonal offering. First, what a weird look for a nut 'brown' ale. It was the same very light amber color as the maple brew sitting next to it, without a hint of brown or any other dark color. OK. Smell is very tame, hints of fallen acorns & distant malts. Taste follows closely. Bare amounts of nut & malt are discernable, but vanish quickly. I'm gettin' nuthin' off this one - if not for the odd coloring, this would define a so-so craft beer. Not much to this. It's beer.Apr 29, 2010"", 'Pours a brown/deep red color with a dense off-white head that has good retention and leaves a lot of lacing.Smells of roasted malts, some toffee and a bit nuttiness.Taste is roasted malts, bready, some toffee coated nuts, little hops and a hint of coffee in the finish.Medium body, smooth with little soft carbonation.Apr 20, 2010', ""I'm a big fan of GIB's seasonals. Here's one I've never tried. Until now. . .This nut brown pours a beautifully clear, deep copper/brown with a two finger off-white head in my Duvel tulip.

Very intriguing.Taste is malty up front with loads of bready, caramel and chocolate notes with nutty nuances. The hops also come through mid-sip and stay through the finish, finishing this beer off well-balanced and clean. Indeed, a nice nutty flavour on the linger.Mouthfeel is medium bodied and creamy but with a relatively high level of carbonation that keeps it clean and simple.At 5%, this would make for a great session ale.

This presents a good, rich flavour and like GI's other seasonals, does not disappoint.Jun 02, 2005"", ""What a nice surprise it was to find a limited release nut brown ale from Granville Island on my recent trip to Vancouver. An often overlooked style that always makes my heart go pitter-patter when it's done well. Poured out of a 650 ml brown bottle, just a quick splash of sticky biege head before it subsides, but leaves some lacing in its wake. The body itself is true to the description on the side of the label, a very fine walnut hue. The aroma seems a bit subdued, but has all the proper fixings for a good brown: both toasted and roasted malt, a bit of woodiness, and the scent of nut shells and husks, with the faintest trace of grassy floral hops. The flavour itself is not very overpowering either, sweet roasted malt, toffee, with a nutty coffee-like finish. This would make one hell of a session beer, a shame I didn't pick up several more bottles of it. It has a velvety light mouthfeel to it, ideal for the style, it rolls over the tongue like a persian rug. This is the finest Canadian-made brown ale I have tried thus far, a shame that it is only a seasonal, but I am more than happy that I had the opportunity to try it while it lasted.Jul 10, 2004"", 'This was a wierd seasonal as it came out on June 21st and nothing says Summer like a Brown Ale. Seriously, this is a very nice dark beer that pairs well with a lot of BBQ food so with the Hefeweizen in six packs and a Pils on the way , bring on the Nut Brown.The beer is malty and smooth suggesting caramel and toffee. This is more Samuel Smith than New Castle and there is a definite kinship to the previous Scottish Ale. I loved the smooth finish and I intend to use this many grilled foods this Summer.

WHY CAN'T ONTARIO BREWERY'S MAKE AN IPA TO THIS CALIBER?May 05, 2015"", 'Hopraiser comes in a really big bottle that apparently contained a lot of sediment; even the first pour contained varying sizes of floating yeast particles. While a little unsightly, these suspended dots do little to disturb the beer\'s truly bright, sunny golden radiance. Bottle-conditioning may have also helped in the production of such a full, steady head. Appropriate for a West Coast IPA - and in this case, being from Squamish, British Columbia this can *literally* be called that - the aroma is reminiscent of forest brush as well as pine needles and sap. But it also has the air of spring flowers which lends a kind of ""pink"" quality to go with all that ""green"". There\'s some definite orange fruit in there too.Accompanying all that hoppiness is a nearly as noticeable malt bill. The use of Munich malt, specifically, is easy to appreciate as the beer has both smells and tastes of fresh-baked bread and toasted farm grains (with a prominent yeastiness emphasizing the notion of a rustic country loaf). The malt provides enough sweetness to soften those 50 IBUs without exterminating them. After all, Hopraiser, as its name suggests, is all about the hops. To that end there\'s an abundance of candied grapefruit, orange and lemon rind flavours in the finish, as well as notes of rose petal, pink bubblegum, pine serum, and grass clippings. It\'s an IPA every bit ""in touch"" with Mother Earth as many in BC and the Pacific Northwest. But Hopraiser is, overall, a stereotypically Canadian IPA in that it presents all its hoppiness (and the corresponding bitterness) in a more tempered and less in-your-face manner than its American counterparts just south of the 49th parallel. (As Canadians, we compulsively define ourselves in opposition to Americans.) To call this a ""more polite"" IPA is not a bad thing, mind you. Hopraiser doesn\'t drink a decimal stronger than its 6% alcohol (I\'d have guessed even less) and its bready malt profile ensures more than just hopheads are looked after. This has what it takes to appeal to wider audiences and yet still loads up on the resiny, citrusy lupulin. It is a truly well-balanced IPA from a very good brewery.Apr 24, 2015', ""000ml bottle that is resealable poured into a pint glass. Reviewed freshly after cracking the bottle. Purchased for under $10 CDN form the LCBO.Appearance - Slightly hazy bright golden straw color with some bronze hues. Two fingers of fluffy white head with decent retention and a nice patchy amount of white lacing left behind around the brim of the glass.Smell - West coast hops all the way, tons of fruity goodness with oranges and grapefruits being the primary conspirators. Tiny bit of leafy hops thrown in but the tropical fusion takes the cake.Taste - Plenty of orange and some grapefruit but also a green tea like characteristic imbued within, some more fruity bitterness maybe passionfruit thrown in and finishes quite bitter. A little bit of honey shows up after a few sips.Mouthfeel - Smooth, moderately carbonated, a little bit oily from the hop oils in the beer and finishes very dry with the bitterness in check.Overall - A solid west coast IPA, that is simultaneously impressive yet fits in without standing out into a group of similar beers.

Grassy, bready, slightly yeasty. Dry. Faint citrus, slight tree sap, wood-chips. Medium-high carbonation, but good body.The canned presentation wants you to believe this is a highly sessionable lager, but it's really not: it's quite dry, a bit heavy, and very flavourful.

So there's that.Jul 21, 2015"", ""Howe Sound Lager has a boisterous golden tone that is deep and gives the beer a very full-bodied look. In contrast to most commercial lagers this one appears to be robust and quite evidently undiluted. Owing to such hearty maltiness highlights and head flourish while clarity struggles. Malted grain is every bit as concentrated on the nose, where mildly sweet and gently toasted barley notes absolutely thrive. The aroma may be straightforward but nothing so commanding should be called simple; whereas I often quickly bore of smelling lagers, this one could keep my attention for hours! For lager lovers, such a clean malty profile is where the heart is. Each sip tastes nourishing, comforting, and wholesome. Its bready, cereal-like flavour and its soft, lightly honeyed lingering is absolutely delectable. Bottom line: beer doesn't get more approachable than this. Few, if any, of the world's beverages provide the satiation and satisfaction of a Dortmund- or Munich-style lager. And yet so few micros (in Canada, anyhow) attempt them. While this is often for practical or financial reasons, it must be said that few craft brewers are all that adept at making lagers... But Howe Sound's brewmaster has a skill set that clearly extends to lagers as well. I wouldn't hesitate to call this the best craft lager in Canada. Mind you, I've been so impressed by the quality and variety of their offerings I already considered Howe Sound one of the country's premier microbreweries.May 16, 2015"", ""5 mL can from a six-pack picked up at the LCBO; no packaging information.

The aroma is simple, but appropriate for this style - biscuity malts, grainy sweetness, some honey and green apples, along with grassy, somewhat floral hop undertones.Nothing but clean-tasting German lager goodness in this one. Pale, grainy malt sweetness and lightly toasted biscuits are the dominant flavours, with some vaguely fruity notes in the background. The hops finish things off, providing a mildly floral, somewhat earthy note that contributes to a slightly bittersweet finish. Light-medium in body, with assertive carbonation that still comes off a little lighter than most imported lagers. Very drinkable, and beautifully balanced.Final Grade: 3.86, a solid B+. This is not really one of my favourite German lager styles, but Howe Sound's Lager is still definitely one of the best Dortmunders I've had the opportunity to try. The malts provide a clean, biscuity sweetness that is perfectly countered by the grassy, floral European hop bill. This is not a complex beer, but it manages to provide everything I expect from this style in spades.

The bready malts and earthy yeast finishes the brew off. Mouthfeel - Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Finishes a tad sticky with the spices and pumpkin lingering. Overall - A well constructed and flavourful pumpkin ale from Howe Sound. The spices and flavours are spot on. One of the better examples of the pumpkin spiced beers out there. This will pair nicely with the pumpkin pie I will be having for dessert after dinner!Oct 08, 2018', 'The 1 liter bottle poured a clear deep amber. The rich aroma included cinnamon and sugar. The flavor is bready and caramel-like, but not overly sweet or spiced. The alcohol is is not detectable in the taste.

GLASSWARE: Schneider Edel-weisse pokal...dense, dark brown amber body that allows little light through... tough to discern effervescence... head is one-finger, off-white and solid in its consistency... nutmeg, pumpkin, cinnamon, clove, and some licorice provide a cornucopia of aromas... the palate is easy-drinking, with some activity up front and a slight warming return... the flavor profile is decidedly cinnamon and nutmeg, with licorice, clove and pumpkin, as advertised... overall, a fine, albeit understated, ale that clocks in at 8%... I like its flavor profile, its balance, and its easy warming feeling... love the fact it comes in a quart bottle with a stopper--not that I will stop until it is finished!Oct 14, 2016', ""Served in a snifter glass. Appearance: Transparent Amber color with heavy bubbles to the body. Head comes off slightly off-white but drops quick before first sip rising initially rising maybe one finger'a length. Smell: Lighty cinnamon and light pumpkin pie. Taste: Sweet and touch malty, light hint of cinnamon and creamy pumpkin. Mouth: Medium carbonation and medium stickiness. Overall: Good brew, little on the malty side for a pumpkin ale but definitely worth the grab. I was a bit spoiled yesterday and think I might have to go back. Salud!Oct 09, 2016"", ""L: Poured from a bottle to a pint glass. Had a dirty brown color and a thick consistency. There was a small amount of foamy head that quickly dissipated. Not much lacing at all.S: A very subdued aroma of pumpkin, spices, and some malt.T: Tasted of some different spices (cloves, cinnamon, and nutmeg), a bit of yeast (not that much), some malt, light hops, and a light bready quality. This could have been a good flavor, but it's uneven and kind of watery. Not nearly and powerful as it should be, but not horrible either.F: A below average amount of carbonation with a mostly smooth finish. Medium-bodied.O: Pumkineater is one of those beers that might have been great if given a few tweaks. Has its good points, but doesn't wholly succeed.Oct 05, 2016"", 'This is the second batch that I have tasted. For an imperial beer. The taste seems to be all natural. In my opinion. This is the standard of what a pumpkin ale should be. There is no tinfoil taste, the pumpkin and spices are bursting with flavour and the lacing is immaculate. If you can get it. Give this beer a shot.Sep 22, 2016', 'A: Pours a crystal clear dark garnet reddish brown in color with light to moderate amounts of active visible carbonation rising from the bottom of the glass and moderate cola brown highlights. The beer has a finger tall foamy dark beige head that reduces to a large patch of medium thick film covering the majority of the surface of the beer and a medium thick ring at the edges of the glass. Moderate amounts of lacing are observed. S: Moderate aromas of pumpkin pie spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, ginger, and anise) with light to moderate aromas of roasted pumpkin and caramel + toasted malts. Hints of earthy hops are present as well.T: Upfront there is a moderate flavor of caramel + toasted malts with a light to moderate amount of sweetness. That is followed by light to moderate flavors of roasted pumpkin and slightly stronger than moderate flavors of pumpkin pie spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, ginger, and anise). Hints of earthy hop bitterness in the finish which does not linger for long.M: Medium bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. O: I love the fact that these Howe Sound beers come in the 1L swing top bottles. Easy to drink and enjoyable, hiding the ABV very well. Nice balance between the flavors of the pumpkins, pumpkin pie spices, and malts.Oct 18, 2015', 'Poured into a Duvel tulip.Look: A rust colored body, opaque ... the color of cinnamon sticks. A cream colored head recedes to a wisp with little or no lacing.Aroma: The spice rack of cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, clove, and a fleshy, real pumpkin meat aroma on the tail end.Taste: Just like the aroma with all the spices of Autumn. A much more pronounced cinnamon finish.Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, goes down very smooth at 8% ABV.Overall: Very much a pumpkin ale in every way, but I do appreciate that aroma and taste of gourd flesh on the back end.Sep 27, 2015', ""Pours from the 1L Howe Sound swing-top almost the colour of cola (albeit somewhat translucent cola), dark caramel/ruby/reddish/brown. A super aggressive pour nets a couple fingers of head that recedes quickly down to a few millimetres and then some islands, but does leave some runny lacing.Smell is starchy, cinnamon, nutmeg, slight pumpkin, licorice (anise, I guess?), caramel, toasted malt, slight biscuit. Pie crust? Very pleasing.Taste is very pumpkin pie. Again, pumpkin, nutmeg, cinnamon, clove. Light licorice. Decent malt body. Rather starchy. Carbonation is rather high and spritzy, and while the body is surprisingly light for the ABV and pumpkin content (too light, almost), there's a certain sharpness, a bile-ish dryness that makes large doses a bit unpleasant.Not bad--the smell is the real winner here, and the 1L format isn't doing this beer any favours, because it's better in small doses--but I remain ever on the lookout for the perfect pumpkin ale.Sep 13, 2015"", ""Was a bit disappointed with this year's version of Pumpkineater. This is usually one if my favourite pumpkin beers. This year's version the pumpkin flavour was very subdued and the carbonation was too active. Actually gave me instant heart burn. I'm not sure if the bottle I got was off or not. I will give it another shot though.Sep 12, 2015"", ""Poured a clear, copper body with reddish tints and two finger head which left a minor lace ring. The aroma is mostly a mix of clove/spice and some nutmeg and pumpkin sweetness (I don't really pick out the cinnamon but I know it's there). Light bodied, smooth, straddles the line between pumpkin flavored beer and beer that just has pumpkin added to it. The cinnamon and nutmeg, along with pumpkin, add sweetness to a spicy beer that finishes crisp. Not the best pumpkin ale out there but worth trying although the dry, boozy finish slightly detracts from beer at times.Sep 04, 2015"", '750 ml bottle, poured into a pint glassAppearance: Pours a beautiful, semi-cloudy, deep, dark, mahogany color, speckled with orange highlights, and a half of a finger of white-colored head that completely covered the top of the beer.Aroma: Delicious! Lots of toasted malt and pumpkin, and pumpkin pie spices such as brown sugar, nutmeg, ginger, all-spices, cinnamon and clove, as well as some black pepper and a hint of dark chocolate.Taste: Just as delicious as the aroma! Lots of toasted malt, pumpkin, and pumpkin pie spices such as nutmeg, ginger, all-spices, cinnamon and clove, up front, followed by tons of brown sugar-like sweetness. As the beer warms up, more and more dark chocolate comes through, making the beer, more complex and deep in flavor. Absolutely delicious!Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied and, nicely carbonated to tickle the taste buds. With an ABV of 8.0%, there is no alcohol on the palate.Overall: This is a damn good pumpkin beer! Strong in all of the pumpkin pie spice-like flavors, but the addition of dark chocolate really makes this pumpkin ale stand out from the rest and makes it very unique. Delicious!Jun 12, 2015', 'L: Hazy copper tinted amber with a vigorous 2” cream colored foam cap. S: Traditional pumpkin pie spices liven up a big pumpkin bouquet. T: Pumpkin pie in a glass with an under current of brown sugar especially on the finish. The nutmeg, clove and anise are very apparent. A small pinch of hops pulls the beer back slightly from the edge of too cloying. F: Medium full body and medium low carbonation. O: Stands on edge of the abyss of too much pumpkin pie character.May 18, 2015', ""A: Pours a clear dark honey color with a finger of off-white head that fades into a thin ring with no lacing.S: Strong spice notes here--cinnamon, nutmeg, and a bit of anise mostly. There are some vanilla and sweet bread notes underneath.T: The spices are a bit less heavy here with caramel malt, bread, burnt sugar, and vanilla coming through. The finish has a light alcohol burn.M: Medium body with lowish carbonation, this beer just avoids being watery.O: A solid beer, overall. I'd like the spice notes to be a bit more balanced and more of a body, but it is otherwise enjoyable.Nov 27, 2014"", 'Pours a murky dark orange-brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, earth, cinnamon stick, and strong clove aromas. Taste is much the same with malt, earth, clove cigarette, and pumpkin pie spice flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a strong clove emphasis in the smell, but the taste has more balanced pumpkin pie spice flavors even though clove is also the most noticeable flavor.Serving type: bottle.Oct 18, 2014', ""Howe Sound's Pumpkineater, Imperial Pumpkin Ale. 8% ABV.A: One and a half finger of fairly fluffy white head.

Very slight pumpkin stem. Clove, very slight ginger, just a hint of cinnamon. A little light on the nose, but has good smells.T/MF: Light and crisp, with decent body. Pumpkin seed sticks out the most. Pumpkin stem, skin, the stringy guts. Not so much the meat/flesh, but not bad. A bit of spice on the finish, but I can't place it.

Cinnamon and nutmeg with light pumpkin. Clean amber beer with hints of pumpkin and spice with light warming.

I didn't even pick up much of the spices I'd associate with pumpkin / pumpkin pie. This was a definite disappointment as a pumpkin ale. It definitely tasted like 8% alcohol, or maybe higher. Bleh.F: fairly thick, smooth.O: I wouldn't buy this again. I was glad my friend Sara really enjoyed it and wanted to finish the bottle so that it didn't go to waste!Oct 14, 2013"", ""A - Pumpkineater is a deep copper colored ale with ruddy highlights. The head is dense, cream colored, and lasting.S - The aroma starts off smelling like pumpkins. Pumpkin moves quickly into pumpkin pie spices, cloves, and nutmeg. These give the rich, savory aroma of pumpkin pie in a glass while also giving balance to the lush aroma of pumpkin. Pumpkins and spices are decently balanced to give a very enjoyable nose.T - Pumpkineater is only medium bodied, a nice surprise given the lush pumpkins found in the nose. The center gives only the faintest hint of caramel but does give more pumpkin pie spices. Those spices give good balance to the sweet, lush flavors of pumpkin. O - Given the richness of what a pumpkin pie provides, Pumpkineater shows surprising refinement and restraint. And what's more the ale carries its 8% abv with great restraint. If I didn't read it on the label I might never suspect this was such a strong ale.Oct 13, 2013"", 'Poured into a tulip, a solid cap of white head, great lacing. Colour is a deep ruby orange brown. S – deep roasty pumpkin, mild smoky nutmeg, caramel malt, nice lively spiciness, a bit of a dark breadiness, pumpkin and spice come through really nicely, rich and balanced. 4T – a really nice caramel spice sweet start, lots of cinnamon nutmeg spice, pepper, maybe a touch of chili, lots of rich meaty pumpkin. Maybe some molasses/ brown sugar notes for sure, leading to a more toasty dry finish with pumpkin pie spices. Refreshing and tasty with good depth. Balance is really good. 4.25M – Pleasant with a big, semisweet body and light carbonation. A bit of sharpness toward the finish, but a drinkable and tasty strong pumpkin.A nice spicey standard take on the style. Enough pumpkin flavor to be noticed but not be too dominant. Still drinks like a well-balanced strong ale but with a lot of the spices mentioned. As far as pumpkin ales go this is certainly a tasty and complex offering and would certainly recommend it. You dont get much of the alcohol presence for sure, it drinks overall fairly moderately with a decently spice-forward profile. A good idea of what the style should be, interesting and tasty without being cloying.Oct 12, 2013', ' liter bottle into a FW tulip. 2013 release but didnt see an exact bottling date.Dark orange color, 1 inch head that dissipates fairly quickly. Smell is of Fall spices - cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, everything you imagine when you think of Fall, though they arent too strong. The taste is a tad different than other pumpkin beers and i prefer this one to them. We get the cloves and nutmeg that dominate here, making it not sweet like a lot of the other varieties. Good flavor in my eyes. Medium bodied with mild carbonation.Overall a very good pumpkin beer that you should check out if youre in the mood for that style. Also, the 1L bottle is awesome.Sep 15, 2013', ""Pours a 1.5 finger head. Dark orange, amberish color body. Seems typical of a pumpkin ale. Head sticks around and there is a bit of lacing. Nice.Aroma consists mostly of sweet, spiced pumpkin pie. Bit of leafy, grassy hop note to it. Slight grain smell. Can definitely smell a lot of spice.Slight pumpkin on the tongue. A generous dose of spices, nutmeg, cinnamon, nutmeg. Low bitterness. Nicely balanced. Leaves a dry aftertaste with a bit of alcohol heat and pumpkin spices.Decent carbonation. Bit too watery. Goes down smooth.Rather surprised. I poured from a 1L bottle all for myself not expecting much because this bottle is actually last years (one year old). Either that or the rep was lying to me, but there was still quite a bit of pumpkin and spice taste to it. With how this is at one year old, I'm really curious to see how it is fresh this year. Nice pumpkin ale from Howe Sound.Aug 19, 2013"", 'Review written from tasting notes.Light anise on the nose with cloves and nutmeg. Taste has none of the anise I smelled. Summer squash/mashed pumpkin. Hint of nutmeg, allspice, cloves. The spices here really add nicely to the flavor and are not distractingly over-the-top. Nice clean malt. Medium body hold together well. Good level of carbonation is complementary. Overall was a tasty seasonal brew, would buy it again.Mar 14, 2013', 'Bottle: Poured a deep amber color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and minimal lacing. Aroma consists of cinnamon and cloves are quite dominant with light pumpkin and caramelized notes. Taste is a solid mix between some cinnamon and cloves notes with some good notes of pumpkin and caramelized malt. Body is full with good carbonation with no apparent alcohol. Solid interpretation of the style and somewhat reminiscent of Pumpking with less aggressive spicing.Feb 03, 2013', ""A: Burnt amber and crystal clear, with a few lazy bubbles finding their way to the surface. Two fingers of creamy head on the pour, but nothing more than a minimal ring around the glass after a rest.S: Roasted pumpkin, cinnamon, cloves, star anise, nutmeg & ginger and some sweet malts. The pumpkin is right there in the forefront of the scent profile as are the pumpkin pie spices. Noticeable absent is the yeast - that may be intentional, but doesn't detract from the smell. T: Forward flavour of roasted pumpkin and pumpkin pie spices, with a hint of bitter hops, noticeable heavy on the star anise. Some rum notes on the back end, like a solid winter drink should be. M: A little thin compared to the big flavour & smell, I hoped for something chewy & coating, however this feels crisp and clean and light. Some nice sparks of carbonation up front on the palate and just a suggestion of booze at the back end. O: The smell and taste are definitely a strong representation of a pumpkin ale, however I find the mouthfeel a little thin. This wouldn't deter me from trying it again because the flavour and scent are so incredibly pumpkin forward. Maybe it's just me, but I think this might make a fantastic beer float!Dec 28, 2012"", 'Amber colour, 1.5 fingers of off white head, some lace here as well. Nose is of cinnamon and ginger followed by a nice crisp malt, quite a bit of vanilla, pumpkin, clove and more spice all well integrated here and the nose is quite lovely. Taste is spicy with cinnamon, lightly bitter, vanilla, bits of a weird acidity too, pumpkin with a doughnut malty finish. Light-medium carbonation, medium body. Pretty good and the nose is wonderful but another 1L bottle of this is out of the question.Nov 19, 2012', ""Appearance: It has a nice cloudy deep orange color to it. It has a nice off-white head that dies down moderately and leaves little lacing.Smell: The aromas definitely give out hints of pumpkin, cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon and sweet malts. Taste: Like the aromas, it has a some pumpkin, cloves, nutmeg, faint cinnamon, a hint of vanilla and sweet malts.

Shared with my wife on Halloween after all the trick or treaters had finished their evening. Poured into a nonic. Dark amber-copper in colour, hazy, nice cap of foam that receded into a fine ring. Certainly shows its gravity. Nose is quite nice - big cooked pumpkin smell here, with some clove, cinnamon and caramel malt as well. A tasty pumpkin ale indeed, again with the fresh cooked pumpkin allowed full opportunity to show off. The spices provide potent accompaniment: again, clove, all-spice, cinnamon and nutmeg. Not as malty or thick as I had expected, but certainly highly enjoyable. While not my favorite pumpkin ale around (that distinction remains in the hands of Pumking), this was still a solid pumpkin ale, well worth the pickup - though at this volume and price tag I doubt more than one is in the cards for this year.Nov 02, 2012"", ""Howe Sound's 'Pumpkineater Imperial Pumpkin Ale' @ 8.0% , served on *cask* at the GCBF'10-'16 & from a 1L pot-stopper bottle , great for home brewing , even at the $8 to $10 range per bottleA-pour is a burnt orange with nice size off white head , that leaves some spotty lacing along the stein/sampler glassS-interesting combination of pumpkin pie spices (cloves , cinnamon , nutmeg ,ginger and star anise) T-wow , a boozy pumpkin sweetness seems to dominate this beer which goes down oh so easy , big tasting even on the swallowMF-good carbonation , great body , ya can feel that 8.0% Ov-good beer , one of BC best Pumpkin Ale , prost LampertLand , 2014 version was *cask* R'umpkineater @ GCBF'14 , wow2016 version was *cask* Bourbon Oaked Aged Pumpkineater @ GCBF'16Nov 01, 2012"", 'Hazy burnt copper pour with a two finger, sort lived light tan head.

Satisfactory lacing down the glass.(4.0) S: Caramel, butterscotch, gingerbread, pumpkin, nutmeg, dark fruits including ripe plum, and orange peel. Mmm. Enticing. Smells like every type of fall/winter season baked good together in aroma form. (3.5) T: Similar to aroma with lots of spices and butterscotch-like malt coming through. I’m also a little surprised at the level of hoppyness in this with quite a fruity flavour. Good but I feel something isn’t quite balanced (maybe too hop forward or an off spice mixture) or perhaps the cross-country trip might’ve done it or maybe I'm just going crazy. (3.0) M: Lighter bodied with a lower carbonation. Thinner and less oily/chewy than expected. Good bittering components from the spice come through.(3.5) D: Aroma was full of varying flavours with some complexity but the taste didn’t quite match that level in my opinion. Would love to try more from this brewer and will be scanning the shelves for their other offerings.Oct 29, 2012"", ""Pumpkineater looks like it's already eaten a few - this beer looks like semi-digested pumpkin and all the colour and clarity you'd imagine that to have. And if that image doesn't sound very appetizing, then good, I've done my job because what's in the glass certainly doesn't look overly tantalizing. Giving off little highlighting, it looks muddied. It's also pathetically flat; not even an upright pour could produce lasting bubbles. You'd have to use a microscopic amount of clove, cinnamon, nutmeg, and anise for the aroma to smell like anything other than those spices. Indeed, this is a spicy, savory amalgamation of all the above (no one ingredient stands out above the others) that conjures thoughts of ginger cookies and pumpkin pie. It also manages a distinct gourd-y note, like fresh-cut butternut or acorn squash (it's also brewed with real pumpkin).While there is a bit of cinnamon heart taste, I feel as though I'll be flossing strings of pumpkin flesh from my teeth instead of cinnamon bark. Surprisingly, maple-y squash flavour holds its own. That's not to say, mind you, that the chai-like profile of clove and nutmeg aren't appreciated - they certainly are. Even the anise is present in small quantity (provided you know to look for it). Quite a nice balance. I suppose it's a draw then. While I wouldn't tinker with the spices, I would up the malts. Refreshingly, for a higher gravity beer there is little (if any) alcohol noticed. However, the other side of that coin is that it also drinks much thinner than a beer of its strength should. The flavour suffers most; it all but dissipates within seconds of swallowing and only a brief memento of the chai note is retained. More biscuity, toasty maltiness would help prop the beer up. Any knocks that I might have about Howe Sound Pumpkineater have little effect on my overall enjoyment of it. Although a wee thin, it's still a fully loaded pumpkin ale that finds balance - and that's not an easy thing to do. Now, whether it's worth the price tag ultimately depends on how much you care for pumpkin ales; it will suit casual pumpkin ale drinkers but it might not suit their budget. I don't regret splurging on it one bit.Oct 26, 2012"", ""L Bottle from the Ottawa LCBO for 11$Appearance - Clear copper colour with an average size fizzy/frothy beige coloured head.

I recognize some clove taste. I also get some ginger and molasses, but those are not listed in the ingredients. Definitely more spice than pumpkin. It is balanced well with hops, it has medium (maybe low) carbonation and a medium body. Overall, I liked it a lot, though it is the first pumpkin beer I've had. I already went back to get more and recommended it to others.

Smells malty, almost toasted. Alcoholic undertones at the end of the scent. Taste (3.5): Initial sweet flavor, that blends into a light bitterness at the end that sits in the palette. Alcohol is evident, typical of an imperial ale. Flavors are not overpowering but rather soft. Nutmeg, clove present, but pumpkin flavors seem to be hidden. Mouthfeel (3.5): Light to medium body, with a rather light watery texture. Lively on the tounge, with a lasting back of mouth moderate to heavy alcoholic feel.

It smells mildly of pumpkin pie spices - cloves, ginger, and cinnamon (hearts) - brown sugar, vegetal gourd flesh (pumpkin, and perhaps some of its squash cohorts), bready, crackery caramel malt, and an underlying twinge of metallic booze. The taste is sweet bready caramel malt, a blend of fall seasonal spices - clove and nutmeg, mostly - well-meshed pumpkin, squash, and even zucchini, and a pleasantly integrated, if a tad edgy at times, warming alcohol. The carbonation is moderate, manifesting in but a plainly supportive frothiness, the body quite full and coddling (like there was a whole metric whack of pumpkin pulp in it), and actually fairly smooth, with a slight whipped dessert creaminess. It finishes more or less sweet, the spiced caramel malt most prevalent.A sort of balanced, spicy, malty, chai tea-esque, and duly warming autumn-worthy beery tipple, one also good for a place where Indian Summer skipped September altogether, preferring instead to show itself in November, of all times.

Inviting.Aroma: Well spiced, malty, pumpkin of course.Taste: Well, Howe Sound have done it again. This is a wonderful beer with a lot of flavour and a step above what you would come to expect from a pumpkin ale - partly because it is an imperial ale, and partly because they seem to hit almost every nail right on the head with their brews.

The taste is much more of the same - somewhat nutty toasted malt, powdery cocoa, an ethereal licorice root astringency, brown sugar-enhanced black coffee, and dry, slightly tangy leafy, weedy hops. The carbonation is a bit clumsy in its probing frothiness, the body a sturdy medium weight, and generally quite smooth. It finishes well off-dry, the nutty malt, lingering cocoa esters, and stumbling earthy and leafy hops holding down the proverbial fort.An agreeable enough brown ale, whose balance among nut, malt and hop, for the style, (though an argument could be made for the Anglo nature of the latter) is duly drinkable.

Or at least one that rarely gets much exposure. Pours a really rich looking mahogany. Not much head/retention. The aroma is dominated by coffee and stout like flavours. A definiate nuttiness like you find in a good strongly brewed coffee. Tastes of coffee and hazelnut. Very nice flavour, complemented with a slight bitterness at the end. The carbonation is a little on the low side, but for a beer with such a dynamic flavour profile, it works. Considering it comes in a 1L swing top bottle, this stuff is drinkable. Standard 5% alc/vol makes it very sessionable. Overall, this is a great beer to drink on a cold, snowy night. I imagine that in the summer, this would be a little heavy.

The taste is bready and biscuity caramel malt, further subtle toffee notes, medium dark chocolate, some oily nuttiness, well-creamed and vanilla-laced coffee, laid-back anise spice, some muddled dark orchard fruitiness, reduced brown sugar syrup, and a still plain weedy, herbal, and grassy verdant hoppiness.The carbonation is quite light in its fleeting frothiness, the body a decent medium weight, and mostly smooth, with a swell airy creaminess arising as things warm up a tad around here (the beer, not actually 'here'). It finishes off-dry, the caramel, coffee, chocolate, and vanilla presiding.Overall, Dark Matter is indeed a pretty flavourful brown ale, one more suitable for dessert pairings, as the hoppy quotient is just not up to Yankee spec.

None of those adjectives can be applied to this aroma which, frankly, doesn't have the goods to pass as a porter, a stout or a brown ale...If anything I'd guess it an English Dark Mild. There is some toasted nuttiness, but not enough. There's some roasted malt notes, but not enough. There's some cocoa flavour, but not enough. Ultimately, the beer tastes good, but not good enough. Mild almost to a fault, I get bored of it pretty quickly. How to describe a beer with little-to-no texture, aftertaste or aroma? The lack of roast, bitterness or prominent flavour makes this a good candidate for a mindless quaff - something with just enough taste to enjoy sipping but not enough to have to think about it. It's best suited to distracting social settings. I'm not a stickler for style guidelines but it'd serve this beer to circle a few well defined style traits and aim for them; it doesn't have enough redeeming character to stand on its own. This lack of clear-cut distinction is surprising given how wonderfully spot-on Hoyne's Pilsner is. Dark Matter has great packaging that simply doesn't suit the liquid in the bottle. Not to say the beer is bad - it certainly is not - but if most people are like me they'll expect something richer, denser and more intricate.

It doesn't quite taste like it looks and smells; the smell and look tells me it should be a nice, heavier, rich mouthfeel bursting with coffee and chocolate. Instead you get just a touch of the coffee and hops but the beer has a somewhat watery mouthfeel that's followed up by fairly pronounced carbonation: those two factors dominate the beer.

As for the brew, it pours a golden color that is cloudy from the yeast suspension...took some swirl action to get it to this point but to be expected....the carbonation is plentiful and aggressive looking, reminding me of a crisp ginger ale in terms of likeness and the lacing tries to do its job and cling to the inside of my glass, but like soap foam, it slides ever so slowly back into the liquid. The head starts out around 1 finger in thickness, and the puffy, slightly off white colored layer retains rather well, I'm guessing from the oats used in the boil. Very decent overall!S- Very fruity right off the bat, with a mouth watering medley of various citrus zest (lemon, tangerine) blended with an assortment of orchard fruits, like apple, nectarine and apricot. Also noting a slightly spicy yeast, biscuit/bread, some dry grain/grassy aromas and a rather sweet wheaty aroma to finish things off.T- Hmmmm, this is interesting, in a good way! I taste the presence of the hops right away....citrus peel and some oily bitterness hit my palate right up front, which eventually give way to some clean, crisp and somewhat malty sweetness. I also detect some of the Witbier yeast that was used, providing some spice to the mix (muted clove and corriander, which is also used). There is a certain smooth creaminess about it too that helps bridge things into the finish, which has a little more of the clean citrus like hop profile.M/O- I find the body of this one to be smooth and solidly medium in nature....as for the carbonation, well it is actually quite pleasant on the palate and gently releases all of the flavors in steady fashion. As for the alcohol, I'd say that while I can taste its' astringency, I'm guessing the aging that I've given this (5+ years), it is very well blended into the beer and one would never know that this was 7.5%. I enjoyed this with some old cheddar slices and it paired very well.....too bad this isn't produced anymore, as I would re-visit this well done Belgian Wit! Maybe some day again....Cheers!Jan 24, 2019"", 'Beautiful example of a Belgian white... on steroids.Amazingly clean nose, but the yeast character still comes through. On the palate: peaches!

Bold and rich, and not the least bit watery (like some stouts I’ve had in the past very the flavours haven’t really melded properly). freshly ground roasted walnut shell with a dry cocoa powder finish.Feel: An ok medium body, but the carbonation is pretty active for a stout, which definitely pushes it away from the creamy part of the scale. It is very gritty and earthy as well. Dry and bitter finish, with a mild linger that is not overly disconcerting, but due to the lack of flavour that usually sticks to it I’d say it is a noticeable mark against.Overall: I was really stoked about the vanilla, which by aroma is quite inviting but I’m not keen on the flavour delivery. It seems to fall just a bit short on really highlighting the vanilla aspect.Pairing : It needs something to either add in the missing malted sweetness, or needs to smooth out the texture - or both.

It finishes off-dry, the now edgy vanilla and tapering caramel malt easily fending off a late generic drying bitterness charge.A decent enough rendering of the style, the slight sourness helping offset the judicious application of the vanilla guest ingredient.

I was very happy to be wrong on this occasion. This one looks nice, a peachy orange-red with around three inches of beige bubbles. Nose is chock full of tropical fruit, with melon, guava, passion fruit, and grapefruit rind detectable along with a mellow yet persistent caramel malt backbone. Apparently this brew contains two hop blends (Zythos and Falconer's Flight) and when you do the math there are something like 17 different hops making contributions here, which could account for why this tastes so wicked. There is a real New Zealand influence here, with the tropical fruit and gooseberry flavors very prominent. I even get some floral rosewater and strawberry, lemon tea, and a darker floral note (tobacco?). This sucker is complex. However, instead of remaining fruity and floral, an aggressive pine resin flavor gathers steam like a menthol cough drop and the finish is bitter and aggressive but not coarse. There is a cool evolution from sweet flavors to green pine bitterness, with a tannic tartness throughout. On top of all this, the malts go beyond the typical IPA sweet profile, starting with some butterscotch and moving toward some toasted and near-roasted notes.

The box is stamped ""05/23/13"", which I have to assume means that this probably isn\'t the freshest IPA I\'ve ever tried. Still, let\'s at least give it a fair chance, eh? Served slightly chilled. Pours a clear golden-amber colour, generating about 1.5 fingers of puffy, pillowy white head. Great retention - it takes the better part of five minutes to recede, caking the sides of the glass in a doily pattern of lacing as it slowly seeps away. Enticing aroma, with a lot of the usual West Coast IPA tropes - grapefruit pith, orange pulp and pine resin can all be detected with ease, in addition to vibes of mango and pineapple. Quite inviting.And not at all misleading, as the first sip confirms that this is a delicious, quality IPA. Caramel sweetness and bready malts contribute much more strongly here than on the nose, but the hops soon come screaming in, offering up a mixture of grapefruit and orange rinds, lemon zest, and some tropical fruit notes. It becomes increasingly earthy into the finish, culminating in a resiny finish combining pine sap and bitter grapefruit. Medium-bodied, with moderate carbonation and fairly high drinkability for the style. Final Grade: 4.14, an A-. Switchback IPA is a well-crafted Canadian IPA, offering enough of a malt backbone to keep things somewhat balanced, while still packing in plenty of West Coast hop punch - more than enough to please the real fans of this style. Probably the best inclusion in this sampler pack by a comfortable margin, although the other 5 brews are certainly worth a look, too. A great IPA that I\'d love to try a fresher sample of - give this one a shot if you spot it locally and are in the mood for something hoppy.Sep 28, 2013', 'Poured into a tulip this had a large rocky white head and left some pretty solid lacing.

The head lasted for around 2-3 minutes before it was gone.Smell - Malts, caramel, light hops, grass/herbalTaste & Mouth - There is an average amount of carbonation and I can taste malts, caramel, and hops. There is also some grapefruit and a bit of mango. It ends with a mildly bitter buttery hoppy aftertaste.Overall - I am sure this is fantastic fresh. I can't find a date on my bottle, but this must be at least a few months old. I will definitely look to try this again if I see it fresh, I can tell it has some promise.Aug 29, 2013"", 'Appearance - Pours an amber/copper colour with two finger of foamy white head. Good lacing left on the glass.Smell - Citrus hops, caramalts, tropical fruit, hint of pine resin.Taste - Citrus hops with a moderate bitterness level, along with caramalts and tropic fruit. Nice touch of pine to balance it out.Mouthfeel - Medium bodied with moderate carbonation that leaves a nice tingle.Overall - A well-crafted and enjoyable American IPA by Lighthouse. Nice hop profile that is on par with the style.Jun 30, 2013', '355ml bottle poured into a tulipA- Golden orange, two fingers of white head that reduces to a thin layerS- Mix of citrus and tropical fruits, touch of sweetness, little pin hopsT- Lots of tropical fruits, little citrus fruits, orange rind and pinesM- Good carbonation, medium bodied, bitter but not over bitter, the citrus lingers for a long timeO- Very good, very well balanced not too hoppy or bitter, really like the tropical and citrus fruitsJun 09, 2013', '16oz pint at Three Boars on a pleasant spring Monday evening.This beer appears a clear, medium golden amber hue, with a thin cap (no worries, I always appreciate a decent pour - kudos, Chuck!) of thinly foamy, yet faintly creamy off-white head, which leaves a few sparse instances of streaky lace around the glass as things sink away.It smells of grapefruit and orange peel, caramel cream, fairly bitter pine resin, a bit of near-stale lemon, and a soft green earthiness. The taste is a surprising uptick in the bitterness, spread deftly across a somewhat tropical fruitiness - grapefruit, papaya, and mandarin orange - with further dank pine needles propping things up, before slowing ceding minority control to a simple, and softly bready caramel malt. That indistinct drying earthiness hangs out, kicking it a bit as well.The carbonation is a tad frothy at times, but generally low-key in its support, the body just on the lee side of medium weight, and mostly smooth, the hops nicking in here and there. It finishes off-dry, a wee bit surprisingly, as the now musty caramel malt benefits from the (time well) spent-seeming nature of the hops.A rather enjoyable bitter, fruity Yankee IPA, whose grace stems from its ability to convince me from the outset that this is a truly balanced affair. Sessionable? Sure - unless all the other patrons ordering it around me drain the keg first (and at 8 bones a pop at that!).May 13, 2013', 'Bottle from Rutager, 12oz into a tulip.Clear orange with a nice two finger white head. Nice retention and lacing. Nose has some light citrus, pale malt and a light pineiness. Taste has some solid citrus flavours, and a light earthy/piney bitterness. Lightly sweet bready malt. Medium feel, fairly notable bitterness. A solid IPA.Jun 29, 2012', ""From notes accumulated since the birth of Zoe.Thanks to chickenm for this one.Poured from a 355ml. bottle.Appearance: Mostly clear with a slight chilled haze on a yellow-gold body. Eggshell white head that is easily 4 fingers and slowly recedes but not less than a fat finger. Some hanging lacing.Smell: Fresh fruit, hops, melon, sweet mango and light pineapple. Very powerful aroma.Taste: Starts a bit tame with some grapefruit, nothing strong then segues into a peach syrup flavor. Strong biscuity malt upfront kind of overshadows the hops. Gets better as it warms as some spiciness and plush orange appear.Mouthfeel: Very balanced but maybe a bit too conservative? The finish is nice and the overall feel is crisp.Overall: Don't drink this one too cold or you might miss some nuances. A good IPA but for me, not top tier.Jun 27, 2012"", ""Thanks to Rutager for this bottle. No freshness info apparent. Poured in to Bruery tulip.A - Light to medium orange. Translucent. One finger of cream coloured head that reduced to a thin layer.S - Nice mix of citrus and tropical fruit. Grapefruit, peach, mango and tangerine. A very slight sweetness is present. T - Sharp bitterness up front with grapefruit, pine and tangerine notes. The tropical fruit from the nose doesn't translate to the palate. A trace of malt sweetness is present in the background. M - Medium body with moderate carbonation.Jun 10, 2012"", ""Thanks to DaftCaskBC for hooking me up with this one a couple weeks ago. Poured into straight pint glass. Poured a lightly hazy golden straw yellow color, with about a half inch of off-white head that had medium light retention and light lacing.The aroma was pine hops upfront, with some grapefruit/citrus notes behind that. There wasn't much grain or malt in the aroma. On the tongue, the pine hops again grabbed your attention first, with the citrus notes following along. There was just enough malt to notice on the taste buds. The beer had a lingering bitter-grapefruit finish.The body was fairly typical for the style, although a bit thinner than i personally prefer. Drinkability was good, if you're a hop head, you could easily drain several of these. Overall, a very nice take on the style. Nothing earth-shattering or groundbreaking, just a pretty good take on a favorite style for a lot of folks. Certainly trying if you see it, and probably worth setting up a trade for.Apr 29, 2012"", ""55ml bottle poured into tulip 12/4/12A golden yellow with a thumbs width of off white head doesn't last all that long but leaves lace where it existed S tropical notes, tangerine, pineapple, guava, mango, gooseberry (avec chat tinkle) the list keeps going, floral with a little pine, smells like a sexy West Coast IPA too me T whats listed above but less tropical flesh, more rind and pine with some earthy hops, still very solid but I preferred the nose M perfect carbonation, bitter for sure but not enamel stripping, flavors linger of citric rind for quite a while, pretty solid hereO a big winner in my books, 4.25 would be useful here for taste and feel so overall scores adjusting accordingly, somewhat balanced and I'm loving the hop profile When this one popped up on the Canadian top 100 my interest was sparked for sure, when it showed up in a box from the most generous Rutager I now understand why. This one would be in my fridge on a constant basis if I could buy it in this part of the world.Apr 12, 2012"", 'A: Pours with barely a finger of white head that dissipates to a thin ring round the glass. Interesting pumpkin orange, clear and very low on bubbly carbonation. S: Piney wet wood, with grapefruit rind and hints of pineapple. T: Taste pops with hoppy bitterness. Similar to the smell, the taste starts strong with woodsy pine resins and white grapefruit rind. There\'s a funkiness of wet earth, if you know the Pacific North West you may get a taste reminiscent of a wet PNW morning. M: For the lack of carbonation in the glass there seems to be a prick of carbonation in the mouth. Medium bodied nice to drink - not to thick not to thin. O: Unlike Red Race IPA, there is no floral scent. Switchback rides heavy on the woodsy taste and smell. If Switchback and Red Racer IPA were perfumes, Switchback would be ""for Him"" and Red Racer would be ""for Her"". Excellent hoppy citrus/woody taste, I may actually have to change my preferred beer from dark Belgian ale to IPA.Apr 01, 2012', 'Appearance. Pours a very clear, rich yellow-gold with a bit of amber and a finger of white head.Smell. Big, big hops. Tons of citrus, sweet pineapple, and a bit of grass and cedar.Taste. Nice toasty malts and again big, big hops. Loads of citrus rinds and grapefruit juice. Not an excessively bitter finish, but the hops do linger a bit. Really nice. Mouthfeel. Below medium in body, medium+ carbonation.Overall. An awesome ipa. Instant addition to the regular local rotation.Mar 31, 2012', 'Excelllent beer served on tap at alibi room in Vancouver. Not picking much up smell wise besides citrusy grapefruit. Told this has a bunch of NZ hops. Whatever it is its quite delish. A well balanced beer. I get more of a dank tangerine profile going on. So the sips of this beer start off dry and bitter and finish with a slightly sweet nectarine oiliness. A very unique beer. Incredibly drinkable. Goes well with food too.Mar 31, 2012', '2oz bottle (355 mL) served in pint glass. Beer pours a clear pale amber with a thin white head. Fresh, cascadey aroma.Beer is dead on with a load of alpha acid and citrusy goodness. As the ABV would indicate, this is a pretty big beer -- a healthy balance in between a west coast IPA and a double/imperial IPA. Mouthfeel is relatively thin in terms of weight, which works well with the moderate carbonation and hop-forward style. Overall I am very pleased.Mar 27, 2012', 'A: 3/4"" cream coloured head that left a nice lacing over amber coloured liquid with excellent clarity. Can\'t ask for much more out of an IPA.S: Pine, earth, grass, grapefruit; smells like we have a hop bomb on our hands. It smells similar to Pliny the Elder.T: Pine, grapefruit, grass and earth up front that gives way to a tasty and sweet malt base. Extremely tasty.M: Medium viscosity and medium level of somewhat foamy carbonation. O: Beautiful. Red Racer IPA and Driftwood Fat Tug move over; there is a new kid in town and he\'s not pulling any punches. I have no problem saying that this is easily one of Canada\'s best IPAs. It has the smell profile of Pliny the Elder and the taste profile similar to Stone IPA but more grassy and earthy, and with a better tasting and sweeter malt backbone to finish it up.Mar 24, 2012', ""Poured into 4oz taster @ The Island Beer FestFWIW, this beer was HEAVILY advertised...like, by far and away more than any other beer @ Club 919!A: Light and transluscent gold, almost pilsner-like, with that big head characteristic of Coast IPAs. Dissipated fast, with clean white lacing.S: Not very strong, but certainly citrusy: pineapple and grapefruit, with some light hop. This was tasted late in the festival, though, so my olfactory sense was slightly compromised.T: Light and surprisingly refreshing, much like a hoppy grapefruit juice. Some pineapple, lots of hop on the finish.M: Creamy but light, this beer has it all. Long-lingering on the tongue, with moderate carb.O: A nice beer, certainly more chuggable than Fat Tug (as I've seen it compared) but not as much as Hop Circle. A good intro to IPAs, and it will certainly see its place on the Victoria scene.Mar 22, 2012"", ""Poured from a 355 ml bottle into a pint glass, courtesy of the Lighthouse rep.A - Dark gold, white head not too frothy and with a bit of bubbles.S - This beer smells fantastic, maybe even better than it tastes. Pineapple dominates the nose, with hints of citrus and tropical fruits.T - Bitter is the order of the day. Citrusy hop flavour, didn't get much tropical fruit, no malt to be tasted here. This is not to say it's an unbalanced beer or an overdone hopbomb - quite bearable.M - Tangy bite, but very refreshing. Not too smooth.D - This is quite a tasty beer, comparable to other BC brews such as Fat Tug or Red Racer. It does wear out the palate a bit from hoppiness.Mar 22, 2012"", ""A: Gold with a frothy white head, great retention & lace. I don't usually comment on the packaging, but they've done a REALLY great job here. Great art work on an open six-pack, non-twist-off, 355mL bottle like a newer American stubby (like Sierra Nevada). As much as I love it, I'd love to see this in cans!S: Very perfumy. Definitely some Simcoe and Amarillo here, with a few other new school hops for plenty of depth: Tangerine, pine, lemon grass, gooseberry, nectarine, a bit dank. T: Piny resin, tangerine, lemon grass, nectarine, mango, gooseberry (but not really catty), bit of sponge toffee from the malt, solid bitterness.M: Well-attenuated, moderate body has a light hop acidity.D/O: Really an all-around great brew. This is in the same league as the Red Racer and Fat Tug IPA... and the bitterness and hopping (aroma & flavour) do seem to fall between the two. Actually, the plethora of hops is probably on-par with Red Racer, but the bitterness is a bit less assertive than the mighty Fat Tug.I'll be buying this one. Lately I've preferred the assertive bitterness of the Fat Tug over the Red Racer Hop fix (bong water?)... but I don't always feel like opening a whole bomber. I can see myself drinking this new-school IPA, as well as the more sessionable, old-school Hophead from Tree.Their small brewer, big flavour series has certainly showed they have talent. I'm glad this is now routinely available.Mar 18, 2012"", 'Damn , Lighthouse is shooting for the stars with this new IPA. Big , hoppy and a citrus nose to die for. I remember how their first IPA was very conservative and styled after the British versions but this IPA is pure PNW and ranks alongside Phillips,Tree and Driftwood as one of the best In BC.Mar 16, 2012', ""Appearance: A perfectly clear gold, could fool anyone into believing its a lager. A nice soapy head on top and some good lacing.Smell: Huge tropical and fruity hop notes! This beers aroma explodes in the nose, so much flavor. I can get mango, passionfruit, a little pineapple, and maybe some peach, very diverse. One of the best smelling IPAs I have ever come across.Taste: Very bitter, right off the bat. After that there is a strong citrus presence that comes into play, and then the tropical fruitiness. This is a very tasty beer, very one sided, I can hardly get a trace of malt character, but still very tasty.Mouthfeel: The carbonation is very crisp and clean, but the body lacks character and the beer feels a little thin if I am being picky.Overall: A must try if you are into the Tropical hop profile, and highly recommended to even those who aren't. Another great IPA from BC, these breweries around here know what they are doing.Mar 14, 2012""]",/beer/profile/2385/79399/

Mt. Begbie was (and remains) one of my favourite BC breweries, largely because I love Revelstoke. I had my first Nasty Habit in Revy and remember thinking how hoppy and strong it was. Overall, its a pretty tame IPA. It pours with minimal head and a mild hop/yeast/biscuit aroma. The taste is quite nice - malt, bittering hops, with a touch of citrus. It finishes quite inoffensively and definitely fits the bill as an accompanying beverage.Mar 12, 2015', 'A: Dark amber liquid with minimal white head.S: Non existent hops, only clean yeast. T: Lemon, buttery, caramel and toffee. M: Medium viscosity and carbonation.O: With the heavy amount of C-120 malt, this would make a good ESB, but as an IPA its lacking. Mt. Begbie should just rebrand this recipe as their ESB.Jun 23, 2014', ""Dark amber colored brew with nice lasting foamy ice colored head. Lacing is grim. Good clarity. Mild aroma. Fairly medicinal. Chamomile, floral, buttery. Kinda uninspired flavors. Easy drinker, smooth, very mild flavors, next to zero bitterness or sweetness. Missing bitterness. Carbonation is medium prickly and nice. Flavors are kinda weak, bland pine, sugary, heavy caramel. Much more of an ESB or amber than IPA. Step 'yo game up Canada!!

S: Caramel, toffee, sweetness on the nose. Bread with maple syrup. Hint of pine and a bit of citrus.T: Caramel and toffee on bread, has a low pine flavour coming in. Once the sip is done and over with you get a risidual sweetness.M: A bit thin, a bit under carb for my taste. However I do find that the IBU are low on this IPA and so is the flavour/aroma of the hops. So in a way the undercarbing is ok as there is nothing to clean up. A bit dry on the finish.O: This is a safe IPA. Good, great to enjoy in large quantity without resulting in being ""hop-ed out"".Nov 29, 2012', 'Bottle: Poured a hazy blonde color ale with a relatively large foamy head with average retention and some alight lacing. Aroma of bitter hops with light citrus notes is not as powerful as I would have expected. Taste is a solid mix between some citrus notes with caramel malt and some floral hops with a bitter finish. Body is light with good carbonation. Not bad but nothing really exciting here.Nov 23, 2012', 'Appearance: gorgeous deep amber; clear; solid, tan head with great lengthAroma: citrus and tropical hops - orange, pineapple, mango golden raisin - and a hint of pine tooTaste & Mouthfeel: those hope aromas are coming through in the taste, but with a stronger resinous pine flavour, predominantly in the finish when it all but takes over; floral notes too, pollen; like a walk through a garden; properly balanced with malt and tree sap sweetness; spot on carbonation and medium body makes for an easy-drinking brewOverall: from the first taste I knew this was one of my new favourite IPAs; the hop flavours have flow, being gentle but not weak, and very interesting; very well craftedNov 18, 2012', ""Pours a tempting deep amber. Nice white head settles to a good film. Spotty lacings. I'm getting a rather unpleasant aroma off this one. Sort of rotten vegetal deal. That seems out of line with most reviews, but hops still seem pretty fresh, so not sure what the deal is. After it warms up the unpleasantness fades away a bit, but it's still there. Big hop hit up front. Resinous pine and grapefruit. That weird vegetal note is there, but not nearly as bad as the aroma might lead you to believe. Malt verges on toasty. Very dark caramel flavours. The heavy malt backbone is partly in the Canadian IPA tradition, with striking similarities to an English ESB. Pretty interesting. This is worth trying. The aroma put me off, but I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. Nice complex beer straddling a couple takes on the style.Oct 10, 2012"", '(3.5) A: Clear copper with a hazelnut shade. A finger of head that disappears quickly but leaves a clinging foam to the glass as this goes down.(4.0) S: Damp woody pine, citrus, rich nutty elements, and a wonderful bread-like malt aroma. Nice and earthy with a solid dose of spices. A real robust and full aroma. Very nice stuff. (3.5) T: A restrained caramel and bready malt backbone with characteristics of generous pine, nuts, spices, and soft grapefruit. Flavours compliment each other well and provide easy drinkability. Bittering pine and floral elements contrasted with just enough sweet caramel and bread. (3.5) M: Medium bodied with a moderate carbonation. Slightly resiny and chewy with a bit of syrup-like stickyness. (3.5) D: Was happy to see another BC brewery available at the local liquor store. Would like to try their other offerings as I found this to be pretty tasty.Oct 04, 2012', ""oz Bomber from the LCBO for 6$Appearance - Clear copper colour with an above average size fizzy/frothy off-white coloured head. There a low amount of carbonation and there is some decent lacing. The head lasted for 4-5 minutes.Smell - Malts, hops, oranges, grapefruitTaste & Mouth - There is an average amount of carbonation and I can taste hops and malts mixed with grapefruit and pineapple. There is also some pine/resin mixed with a bit of a apricot sweetness.Overall - I was pleasantly surprised by this one. It has some flavours found in a DIPA but in a lower ABV format. It could use a touch more hop bitterness but it has a perfect amount of sweetness. I'll buy more.Sep 29, 2012"", ""2 oz bomber bottled July 26th. Poured into a nonic pint glass.A - Deep copper colour, when poured one finger of tight white head that dissipates quickly leaving a bit of a film on the glass, and minimal lacing.S - I get a lot of pine and resin out of this beer, it's got a bite, which is pleasing. T - Unfortunately the taste doesn't really transfer over. It tastes watery and not really what it smells like at all. A bit of pine on the finish.M - This beer goes down really well, nice carbonation, light to medium body on it. As a result of the hops not really converting here, it goes down like water.O - Not a terrible IPA, it's not as fresh as I'd like it to be, but in Ontario, it's as fresh as it gets. If I could find a fresher bottle I'd give it another try, otherwise I doubt it.Sep 28, 2012"", 'Poured from the bottle into a tulip pint glass.A real nice orange amber body, quite clear and some minimal rising carbonation. Head is light tan and always manages about a centimeter of a collar while drinking. Good lacing, and some minimal retention.Nose hits with tea like hops. Herbal grass. Slight sweet malts hide in the backbone, with a subtle touch. Overall not bad.Taste hits with a good hop blast. Flavor feels very tea like and herbal. Slight grass and a lingering sense of mellow orange and bitterness. Chewy hop oils coat the palate quite nicely, body is very solid and rich, with a decent malt backbone, often pops out with a bit of sugar sweetness.This tastes more English than American to me, but no complaints. A decent IPA worth drinking either way.Sep 28, 2012', 'Pale reddish-copper colour, about a finger of off white head, some lace as well. Smell is of juicy citrus hop, pink grapefruit and orange mostly, underlying presence of lightly toasted malts, but nice and hoppy at the forefront. Tate is all citrus and tropical fruit, grapefruit, orange and lemon, bits of caramel and toasted malt, lightly sweet and bitter throughout. Med carb and body, oily at points. Good but not a world beater, very solid and worth a revisit.Sep 25, 2012', ""A: A clear deep copper amber with delicate slow bubbles forming a cream laced cap. S: Top notes of sweet malts followed by grapefruit, a caramelized grapefruit rind. Some hints of minerals at the end. T: This brew strikes first with mild malts followed with fruity bitter hops. On parting there's a mild bitter after taste, nothing too pronounced and definitely balanced off by the malts. M: Light to medium with a mild carbonation. my drinking partner and I agree it's a little on the light side. O: For an IPA there seems to be a fair share of malts, it's a decent brew with a reasonable mix of malts and hops. Great art work on the bottle, the brew feels a little low on hops or too thin on mouth feel, on a hot day that might well be enjoyable.Sep 01, 2012"", 'A: clear bright copper; head dissipates quicklyS: little; some slight grapefruit rind;T:soft, rich, mellow; bitterness is there but not very noticeable except in the finish; wish there was more hop character; very well balanced to the point that malt and hops seem to cancel each other; pleasant as a session IPA but I think it would get lost with food which is when my favourite IPAs really shine I think.M: very rich and full bodiedO: a very nice beer that I would buy again but not particularly memorable.Jul 21, 2012', 'Bomber acquired at the MLCC within 2 weeks of its touchdown in Manitoba. Poured into a Hoegaarden glass.A: Clear copper with a nice head and pretty darn good lacing.S: Soapy. Lack of hops on the nose. A hint of earth and bit of sweetness. Completely off for what I consider an IPA to be.T: Sweetness with a bit of bitterness. Caramel, burnt sugar, a touch of spicy hop. Not much else.M: Well carbonated, finishes drier than it looks. No building biting bitterness of an IPA.O: IPA? This is a barely serviceable English Pale Ale. Honestly, bought two bombers with one to send out on the CanBIF. I am pretty sure I will be returning the bottle. I cannot send this out and feel good about it...May 10, 2012', 'Appearance - Pours a clear dark amber hue with a 1/4 finger width of bubbly white head.Smell - Pine and floral hops, citrus, tropical fruit.Taste - The hops shine through in a moderate fashion, along with hints of citrus fruit. Touch of breadiness and maltiness. Slight bitterness at the finish. Mouthfeel - Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Dry finish.Overall - A good American IPA by Mt. Begbie.

Small, fine bubbles, on the base. Thick white head, dissipating fase to a neat white ring of lacing.S: Faint hop, but more floral than astringent. A little candy-like suger, and some citrus after. Overall, a little underwhelming.T: Much better than the scent, hop and citrus give way to a nicely burnished malt. A little floral phenols, with a bit of nut and a hoppy aftertaste. A little thin, but refreshing.M: Bubbly carb nicely compliments the taste. Rolls fizzy on the tongue, but could be a bit thicker. Overall, about what I'd expect.O: A good all-round IPA, nicely palatable. Much better than their Brown Ale, but not the best IPA I've had. Just a bit too thin..Mar 22, 2012"", ""Oh yeah. I'm liking this.Pours a moderate head that settles to a thin film, leaves fine lace. Muddy, hazy orange colour. Great nose, smells fresh and inviting. Oranges, pine laid over a sweet malt.

Great name and art. No freshness dating. Using an oversized wine goblet.Pours a hazy, grapefruit tinged copper color in the center, with a light golden amber making up the outer half. Not much head except a bubbly tan colar. Spotty lacing.Smells like caramel, fruit punch and chocolate. A bit too sweet for me but it's definitely a full aroma. Tastes like caramel or toffee, sugar, then has a bit of chocolate and coffee taste. Bitter finish with a thin diacetyl buttery flavour.Syrupy mouthfeel. Has a sour cherry tone to the aftertaste. This was definitely and old IPA, but retained a lot of bitterness when it became a dark caramel bomb. Reminded me of Dead Guy Ale quite a bit. I definitely need to try a fresher iteration of this one.Sep 17, 2011"", ""Poured from a bomber into a schooner.

Fluffy white head resolves after a few minutes and leaves some sticky lacing.S - delightful wet hopped character with lots of pine and grass. Very inviting and can't wait to take a sip.T - initial moderate bitterness and grassy hops balanced out by a fairly strong, but subtle maltiness. Hop flavor is a bit less than the nose seems to suggest. Enduring bitterness on the front of the tongue. Very nice thirst quenching quality. Not much citrus in this one, but nice and solid pine resin quality.M - medium bodied with a lot of carbonation, perhaps too much? No booziness or alcohol warming.D - quite drinkable; the bitterness doesn't overpower and it's got a nice strong malt backbone.

Smells of light citrus, pine, bread, some earthiness and a little sweet malt. Decently hopped but not necessarily hop-focused. Bready with grainy malt. A bit roasty for an IPA. Some drying grapefruit on the finish. Maybe fuller malt through the middle would be a nice improvement. Good medium-full body and medium-light carbonation. Drinkable enough but pretty unmemorable.

Light caramel and dough malt notes and some piney hops fill the nose. Hop bitterness is the prominent feature of the taste, but its less brash than most America IPA examples. Some melon and grapefruit flavors mingle with the aforementioned pine. Cookie dough malts provide a more than ample counterpart to the hops. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a nice subtle carbonation. Finish is lightly bitter and doesnt linger long.This is a decent IPA. I prefer them hoppier, but this is very tastey.

About a finger's worth of head formed while pouring with little retention. Good lacing.S - Pine hops and definite fruits in the nose, the grapefruit is quite pronounced in there. Malts and an earthy smell are also present.T - Quite different from the smell. The pine and grapefruit hop flavours are certainly there, but they are masked by a stronger taste of biscuity malts and earth tones. Not really what I have come to expect from an American IPA. That being said, the hops do present a subdued bitterness that compliments the flavour. It isn't sweet nor bitter, rather a neutral flavour of biscuits and earthiness with just a hint of both extremes. M/D - Good carbonation with a light/medium body. Drinkability is also quite good.Nothing really stands out about this beer in my opinion. It is good to drink, but I don't think that the price ($5.50) was really justified.

All in all it seemed hoppy but at the same time it didn't have the same bite that most hoppy beers do. It had more initial sweetness than anything. There's a lot of caramel and almost candy taste that balanced the hops out a lot. M- Medium body. Smooth. Carbonation was right as well. Not really aggressive feeling, but more light for it's style.D- Easy to drink, and seems a good drink to aim at people who need a halfway point to most IPAs.

I guess it would depend what you were in the mood for.For some reason, it took 2 months for this beer to make its way from the brewery to the lcbo. Although that's within the acceptable range for an IPA, depending on the hopping, I can imagine this tasted better a month ago. Then again, maybe not.Oct 28, 2010"", ""Pours a medium amber with an off-white head. Laces nicely.The aroma is grapefruit pith, pine and caramel.The taste isn't nearly as bitter as the aroma led on. Some nice biscuit, caramel and grapefruit zest.Carbonation level was a tad low.And yeah. This was merely okay for me. Much more of a pale ale than an India Pale Ale. And I don't find myself with much to say about it one way or the other.Oct 25, 2010"", ""Usually I keep pretty good tabs on the LCBOs release schedule, but this one snuck through the cracks, so it was a pleasant find. Consumed at a pumpkin carving party on a grey fall day - fairly appropriate! Poured into your basic curved ale glass. A brilliant copper amber hue, with scads of frothy off-white head. Good, long-lasting lacing patches, excellent retention. Looks terrific.The nose is a fine blend of West Coast and English hops, citrussy and earthy, although the former has a bit more stage presence. Malts provide background attention.The hop presence in the taste didn't quite live up to what the nose led me to anticipate, (late-hopping, perhaps?) but it's still a flavorful brew. Malty, but with a solid earth and citrus hop backing. A certain mineral character as well, something I'm quite used to, living near the Grand River. Finish is slightly dry, encourages repeat sampling.Mouthfeel is a touch flat, but creamy and satisfying. Not a bad pickup at all, a bit pricey, but I'll happily pay a little extra to finally get some BC micros out this way. An enjoyable sipper, hops are used as flavor, but aren't THE flavor, which I appreciate now and then. Worth a go (now if only someone could explain what the hell is going in on the label?)Oct 25, 2010"", ""Poured a hazy orange-amber with a small but creamy white head that lasted quite some time. The nose is citrusy, with notes of grapefruit, tangerine and some pine.The taste is a bitter mix of resiny pine and citrus with a decent caramel malt backbone. The finish is a nice lingering mix of bitter hops and spice.Medium-bodied with nice carbonation that lets this one dance across the tongue. A nice balanced IPA... Ontario's been getting a little spoiled lately, relatively speaking with all of these decent IPA's showing up...Oct 21, 2010"", ""What appears a hazed, besmeared and dull shade of tawny becomes a sharp, crisp and resplendent auburn when up against the dreary autumn sky (a scene which, it must be mentioned, the beer's colour instantly lends itself to). The head, unfortunately, had about as much life left in it as the withering trees and, like them, it too was soon bare. The smell of rank citrus comes over you like a tidal wave - it's like a giant, mutated monster of a Florida orange grove, one that is more bitter, more resiny and far more stinky. A zombie-grove, if you like; one that has deserted the sugar in place of a torrid alcohol and ramped up the acidity until the knob broke off the meter. Sure, I'd buy that for a dollar! The beer is thin but considerably rich in flavourful resins. Its mouthfeel is left impressively unperturbed by bitterness, acidity or sweetness; I'm unsure whether that's a pro or con. The beer's hoppy resins and malty syrup hit the tongue with little help from the carbonation and, as result, tend to linger there indefinitely, like clueless (but affable) house-guests. Your taste-buds really don't have much to complain about. A refreshingly acidic, briefly minty, generously citrusy hoppiness offers up flavours of pink grapefruit, orange pith and jasmine tea, while a sufficiently toasty maltiness parcels out a trickle of pecan-like nuttiness and nibbles of nougat and caramel. It tastes like a citrus-accented praline (mmmm!) There's certainly nothing nasty about this beer and, indeed, it's one that I could easily get in the habit of drinking. I don't care that my IPAs are innovative or insightful - I care only about character, quality and drinkability; this offering is nothing if not serviceable and, while not a world-beater, makes a welcome and warranted addition to the beer fridge.Oct 21, 2010"", 'Poured a nice medium amber colour and is definitely a filtered IPA. Had a nice citrus and earth bitter aroma from the hops with some grapefruit and tangerine notes and a nice sweet malt backbone. The palate was weak compared to the nose. Some hop bitterness up front with light citrus and earthy notes and a subtle malt sweetness rounding it out. Overall the hops were not as bitter as expected for the style and the beer was very light and watery at times. Overall a good IPA but almost seemed like a ""light"" IPA.Oct 20, 2010', 'A very drinkable beer. It pours a medium yellow with a minimal white head. There is a good C-hop aroma. Middling mouthfeel. A little lace in the glass. It is not over the hop bitterness, but very tasty.Very smooth drinker, a transition beer for ESB fans.Oct 18, 2010', ""0 ml bottlePart of the LCBO's Halloween release.Pours a deep semi-clear amber with little head. Smells of hops and citrus dominate the nose. The taste is a rather nice smooth IPA, slight bitterness at the sip and a rather subdued finish. Lingering citrus aftertaste. Perhaps a little undercarbonated in the mouth, moderate feel.Overall, not a bad little IPA from the west coast of Canada. Goes down real smooth. If this was in 355 ml bottles I coould see picking this up regularly. As is it, being in Ontario, one bomber is plenty for now. Quality job and a great pick for a seasonal here.Oct 18, 2010"", ""Pours a copper colour that starts off with fairly thick white head. Dissipates quick enough with some pots of lacing. Smells of pine and pineapple hops with some sweet caramel. Flavour doesn't have the same hoppiness the smell may indicated, but it is bitter still. Carbonation level is good. I would buy a more of this if the Garrison IIPA and Corne du Diable didn't just come, and I prefer them both.Oct 16, 2010"", 'A most excellent IPA, in a province where there are two other heavy-hitters in the market (Hop Head & Paddy-whack from Kelowna & Nelson, respectively) plus another from a bit further afield (Amnesiac, from Victoria).I have enjoyed many Revelstoke brews over the years but this one is my new favorite of theirs.Nice hop aroma, caramel malt notes + a pleasant bitterness in the taste. Looks good in a glass too.Very drinkable. Nice!Oct 13, 2010', 'Pours a dark copper color with a fairly thin off-white head. Citrus hops, pine, and caramel in the aroma.

A bit of cinnamon spice seems to linger on the palette as well, which was unexpected yet interesting.M - This one finished a little dry, too much so for my liking, but the carbonation was nicely balanced, making it very smooth.D - Deelicious! Wonderfully impressed by this offering, and would totally buy this if we had this in Alberta. My favourite of the Mt. Begbie offerings I've tried to date.

Dated 10510, so I'm guessing May 10/2010?Beer is a light copper/amber with an off-white head, settling to a thin cap. Solid lacing, even within the tulip. Cool bottle artwork too, but I wouldn't count that towards the appearance. Smell of grapefruit, slight pineiness, and citrus. Toffee/caramel malt to boot. Typical. Flavour lacks alot of bitterness but still presents some nice citrus notes, and an overall flavour fairly similar to the aroma. Slight dryness on the tongue after each sip, with a slight note of alcohol as well. Light body, medium carbonation and all in all a nice drinker, and fairly typical in almost every respect for the style. Enjoyable. Recommended for a warm summer day.Jul 25, 2010"", '50ml bottle. I like the Hades influenced imagery on the label - and the name inspired me to put on the old Offspring song ""Bad Habit"", for that drinking/music congruence so desirable on a Saturday night.This beer pours a clear, bright medium copper amber hue, with two fingers of weakly puffy, and tightly foamy off-white head, which leaves a near-perfect honeycomb pattern of lace around the glass - this is one fine-looking beer, Stella Artois can kiss this girl\'s ass. It smells of white grapefruit and bitter orange rind, dank pine, bready caramel malt, and further herbaceous, floral hop notes. The taste is biscuity, grainy bready malt, strong (heh) herbal tea, mild savoury black pepper spice, and a reduced grapefruit/pine essence from the original olfactory promise, one slowly being replaced by an earthy, musty, and vegetal bitterness. The carbonation is average, just a wavering frothiness, the body an adequate medium weight, and perhaps a bit airy in its plain smoothness. It finishes off-dry, the wan biscuit malt, spice and nearly ethereal by now hops at least crisp in their cooperation, if in nothing else.Another generally, and stereotypically nice Canadian version of the American IPA, with more emphasis on the biscuity malt and sedate bitterness, than the bracing West Coast hop way of things, sigh. On the whole, though, quite easy to drink, seeing as my tooth enamel has nothing to worry about. I just wanted a fix for this nasty (IPA) habit of mine, is all, and I didn\'t find it here.Jul 17, 2010', ""Not an absolutely outstanding beer from Mt. Begbie, but its nice to see them doing something new after so many years. Being in the Lower Mainland, I think I miss out on their brews quite about.Average for the apperance as I'm drinking this from a leather tankard.Nice hoppy smell, mild malts and suggestions of citrus and cut grass. The taste is siilar, though a bit sour but not something that sets me off. Citrus, floral hints and mild, bready malts.Good mouthfeel and even in a bomber a nice beer to sit back and enjoy.May 11, 2010"", ""A: Copper-bronze with a light-tan head, light retention, good lace.S: Grapefruit rind, nectarine, grass, candied pineapple, toffee.T: Grapefruit rind, nectarine, biscuit, candied pineapple, toffee, modest bitterness for the style.M: Fairly light body, carbonation is a little high, light hop acidity.D: A decent drinker, but it didn't leave me 'lusting for more'.Apr 16, 2010"", ""As I pop the top the room is filled with a sweet, sticky, spicy, herbacious aroma. My glass is greeted by that familiar light copper and clingy head that so many IPAs are guilty of. Upon supping my mouth is filled with an explosion of tropical fruit flavours. Mango, pineapples, guava, grapefruit, orange, they're all there. A round, but very sweet, caramel backs them up. Overall I think this beer would benefit from more hops to balanced the sweetness and give it a bit more punch.Apr 07, 2010"", ""Nice to see the Mt Begbie crew shake things up a little since they seemed to be brewing the same few beers for many years. The great Kolsch is now in cans and here is their first IPA.Cool new artwork on the label which is a nice change from the historic photo theme they have been using for years. The beer is pretty darn hoppy with a big nose and a dark tan colour with decent head. This is a very good IPA that pre- Central City would rank among the best in BC. Lots of citrusy hops and a lovely fresh taste make this one for the hopheads and not a concession for the average drinker such as Granville Islands IPA. What makes Central City's Red Racer better is the balance with the malt and the rounder mouthfeel. That being said this is a great addition to the Begbie lineupMar 31, 2010"", '2oz bomber of Mt. Begbie\'s newest offering sent to me courtesy of EskimoDave - cheers mate!Pours a crystal clear burnished orange, almost a reddish autumn hue to it. Finger and a half of creamy tan head builds up and has some staying power, maintaining a thin sweater on top and leaving spots of lacing down the glass.Nose is very West Coast hop-ish - bold pineapple and mango, grapefruit and candied orange rind. Not overly thick, a light sweetness though.Pretty sweet for an IPA. Pineapple juice, light grapefruit, hint of oranges, mango - nice hop profile. Little to no hop bite though, quite mild for an IPA. With the combined sweetness, lack of much bitterness and the thin-ish mouthfeel thjis could almost pass as ""hop juice"", not that that\'s entirely bad.I love the West Coast hop profile so the hopping in here is great, I\'m just left wishing for more of a bite in the finish to counter the sweetness. Still, pretty damn drinkable and would love to have something like this around these parts. Thanks Dave!Feb 04, 2010']",/beer/profile/4048/55875/

Very strong nutty flavors, with caramelized brown sugar, barley wort, toffee, slight coffee milk chocolate, bread and yeast that lingers. Earthy gourds such as slight pumpkin and perhaps some creamy butternut squash....very interesting...very suitable for the fall season! The finish has just enough hop bitterness to refresh the palate but it is very muted....M/O- Medium bodied and tight, yet zingy carbonation make this a very drinkable beer, but it would most likely fill the belly up quickly!

I rather like the heritage mountain mining town imagery on the label - a workin' man's beer!This beer pours a clear, fairly dark reddish brown hue, with one fat finger of reservedly foamy, and mostly soapy, bubbly beige head, which leaves a wee ring of lace around the glass as it quickly falls away. It smells of mildly biscuity caramel malt, with a sweet, oily nuttiness, a subtle hint of dark chocolate, a bit of red grape fruitiness, some ethereal sugar syrup, and plainly fruity, floral hops. The taste is lightly toasted, somewhat edgy caramel malt, a mixed bowl of bar-top nuttiness, grape soda (I know!), a hint of watery raisin that somehow borders on Turkish figs, and earthy, musty, and floral hops. The carbonation is a bit all over the place up front, even a bit on the high side at times, but eventually settles right out, the body on the lee side of medium weight, and unfortunately average for the style, with a further bit of damning watery essence in its ill-advised attempt at smoothness. It finishes more or less dry, the fruity character not really bringing the sweetness, as the nutty and hoppy essences pull their reins a fair bit tighter.A decent, adequate, and inoffensive offering, with a middling malt, and understated hoppiness, sure, but nothing memorable enough to warrant me seeking it out again. The sort of thing to put back mindlessly at a party once you've established your non-BMC predilections - been there.Mar 25, 2009"", ""This past Friday night I did a blind tasting of brown ales with my wife, because I figured it was time for me to re-evaluate a style I don't think much of. We each poured samples for the other, noted what was what and then brought out the beers, so while we couldn't taste the same beer at the same time, we were both able to taste without bringing any bias to the table.The Tall Timber fared okay, but it was my least favourite, because it seemed to lack some of the depth and complexity that the others brought. Its appearance was solid, if actually a tad darker than the other brews, exhibiting a deep mahogany hue, and nice tan head. The aroma is fairly muted, with notes of brown bread and treacle, but most disappointing of all a nasty tinniness that crops up occasionally. The flavours are straightforward sweet malts with some brown break and caramel. Again though, it somewhat spoiled by a flaw, as I keep picking up a sharp edge lurking in the background flavour. The body too, is also inferior to the others. Too light and insubstantial.It was interesting trying this in comparison to four others because it gave multiple reference points and helped me understand where Mount Begbie stand in the field. Unfortunately I would put them at the bottom. Its not a bad brew, and the drinkability is fine, but there's nothing complex going on, and the presence of the odd flaw distracts from what is otherwise an easy drinker.Thanks Alex (Voonder) for sending this out.

Nearly opaque.Aroma is nutty, with light notes of brown sugar and caramel.The sweet nutty flavor mingles with a caramel creaminess, some raisin and fig floating around in the back. Juicy at first, but has a very drying finish that makes you long for another sip. The carbonation is moderate, with a thinness in the mouth that isn't necessarily weak or airy. Not an assertive, unusual, bonkers brown ale...but they usually aren't. I was given this bottle, and enjoyed it, though probably wouldn't go out of my way for it. But in the end it's a solid brew.Jan 14, 2007"", ""I won 2 bottles of this beer as a prize package in a homebrew competition.UPDATE: After gaining more review experience and sampling the 2nd bottle, I felt the need to update my original review.650ml bottled served in 20 oz pint glass.Pours a clear dark brown, light easily passes through which gives off red hues. An agressive pour creates a small head which quickly recedes to a ring. No lacing.Smell is of sweet malt with a bit of chocolate, no roast detected. Very pleasing.Taste is similar to smell, sweet carmel malt is up front, which turns to smooth chocolate and then finishes cardboardy-dry.Low carbonation matches well with the style. Mouthfeel is just about right, anymore and it would be too much for this somewhat sweet beer.Drinkability is average. Too sweet with an unpleasing aftertaste. A decent enough brown ale, but really nothing compared to Bushwakkers Sodbuster Brown (by which I judge all others). I don't think I'd want another one of these.Dec 13, 2006"", ""Maybe it's harsh of me to say so after sampling only a few of this brewery's offerings, but I'm inclined to nickname it Mt. Bland-bie.This is a decent enough, drinkable beer, but there's absolutely nothing about it that would make me reach for it again.It poured a medium brown colour from the bottle with a two-finger, tan head. Even with the aggressive pour, the head diminished to a thin ring within moments and left no lacing on the glass.The smell was a nice balance of toffee and malt with just a hint of hops. The taste delivered toasted malts and some coffee bitterness and it had a nice, medium-bodied feel on the palate. It left no aftertaste of any description as it went down \x97 nor any lasting impression on me.Mar 14, 2006"", ""0 ml bottle served in a pint glass.Clear, medium brown with red highlights. Almost a nice light cherry wood colour. Head is dense and light brown in colour. Head recedes to a tight ring around the edge.Roasted malts with nutty and sweet highlights dictate the aroma. Some caramel and faint hops in the background.Richly malted and slightly sweet. Coffee and nutty undertones. As the ale warms a nice warming alcohol aspect pokes through as well as some woody tones. Aftertaste is mildly dry and mainly malt-bitter. As it warms a burnt sugar taste pops up towards the finish and into the aftertaste.Medium - full bodied delicious mouthfeel. Lightly carbonated.This is one of the best (if not THE best) Brown Ale I've ever had. The warming alcohol effect later in the glass tends to tone down the drinkability making this more of a sipping brew rather than the sessional ale it makes itself out to be when served colder. None the less, this is a gem found at a small brewery in a small town in the middle of the BC interior. Note: When I first tried this at the 1999 Harvest Moon Beer Festival, it won the People's Choice award as best in show as selected by the attendees.Jul 11, 2005"", 'I suppose I should put it out there from the beginning, that I\'m not a lover of brown ales. I will admit to having my opinions of them colored by my first exposure to Newcastle some fifteen years ago, and they haven\'t really varied much from that first incident: Too sweet. So I rarely, rarely get myself a brown ale. I\'m also a little concerned about writing the review right now, as I\'d like to be watching the Mariner game, but both TVs are currently occupied (""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"" by the boys, and some show about how to off your husband and have no one be the wiser on A&E). However, I was on holiday on Vancouver Island, shopping in BC Liquors and trying to pick out a healthy selection of beers to bring home, and I grabbed this one (after much internal debate). I\'m glad I did.Appearance: Actually, this beer is lighter than I expected it to be. Colorwise, it occupies a very nice middle ground between a pale and a porter. It\'s brown. Go figure. The pour was initially rather spastic, so it foamed right up, but I got that under control and managed to finish off the pour with a nice 1"" head that stuck around while I let it come up in temperature for a good ten minutes or so, but disappeared quickly after the first sip. As I look at it now, there is still a white ring of foam around the edge, and some lovely carbonation making it\'s way lazily up the glass. This beer looks incredibly happy to be in my glass.Smell: Even cold, you can smell the malts. Not cloyingly sweet, but pleasant. As could be expected, they become even more prominent as the beer warms up. No hint of hops at all.Taste: Oooh, this is smooth. Very nice. Malt at the forefront, a pleasant brown sugar with a slight hint of grainy bitterness in the middle, and then a warming alcohol finish. This is a lovely beer, and tastes bigger than it\'s 5.5%.Mouthfeel: This is where the beer falls short. I\'d like a little bit more body to this beer. Some velvet to complement that brown sugar. It\'d make the balance of this beer magnificent, and raise the grade up to a 4.Drinkability: Very nice. I probably couldn\'t do more than two, as I\'d become increasingly more bothered by the lack of cohesion between mouthfeel and flavor. But I know my dad could session the crap out of this beer. It is right up his alley.Good work, Mt. Begbie. I\'m impressed.Jun 17, 2005', ""Another great brew from Mt. Begbie! Pours into my glass a distinct amber-mahogany colour with a fluffy, slightly off-white head. Smell is a nice blend of chocolate, barley malt, hops and nuts. Slight sweetness to the smell.Good malty taste with a hint of sweetness that reminds me of Ovaltine. Faint hops, hints of nuts. A good blend. My only complaint is that it feels a bit thin compared to Spinnaker's nut brown ale (my current favourite brown ale) but otherwise is a very drinkable ale.Apr 18, 2005"", 'Big thanx to Irondjinn for providing me a sample of this beer. A very dark amber beer with no head retention, actually the head reminded me of the D-day landing ""it came but quicky dissapeared"" like me grand-da would say. Roasted malt smell, with caramel flavours, and a sweetness is there.Her taste is like her smell, but very very sweet, reminded me of an albino milk stout.Mar 15, 2005', 'Got this from a non-Beer enlightened friend who spent a few days out west. He just picked it up at random from the shelf.Appearance: Brown with reddish highlights, with very light head.Smell: Not bad, quite nutty in fact.Taste: Lightly smokey, with some caramel. It sort of reminds me of cola. I\'m not much of an expert on that, I drank my last Coke/Pepsi about 3 years ago, but the look, texture and taste really made me think it was cola for a sec. I\'m not much of a connaisseur in ""english brown ales"" either, but it just felt like something was missing...The look was acceptable, the smell interesting, it just lacked a little body. I\'m glad I gave this a try, but if I ever head out to BC I won\'t go out of my way for this one.Dec 07, 2004', '--Came in a large 650 ml brown bottle. Freshness markings are found on the right edge of the label.--Poured a nice reddish brown in color. A nice head that had a decent lacing.--Kind of a sweet, malty smell.This is without a doubt the best brown ale I have tryed yet. It also ranks up there with one of the best overall beers I have had the honour of tasting! It was not too thick and not too smooth...with just the right amount of body. This one will make a regular appearance in my fridge, especially when people come over knowing I always have something differant to try. I look foreward to other Mt. Begbie offerings.Aug 30, 2004', 'I\'m not a fan of the English brown ale genre but this brew is ""Canadianized"" enough to make it a good drink after skiing at some Revelstoke lounge (as I\'m sure this was the intebded market for this brewer). Poured a clear dark copper color with a smallish, fine-foamed cap that laced out. light smells of ale hop and sweet malt, grassy grains. Started rather watery and bland then the malt pronouncement kicked in as the mouthfeel becomes more oily....the finsh was smooth but unspectactular with a lasting bready-biscuit like after taste....very subdued in the hops for an ale....but very drinkable.Apr 29, 2004', 'An OK ale, better than a national brand. Some genuine brown ale taste and lots of malt but too much carbonation. I think the brewery tends to use too much malt and carbonation on their product line. Tip off the hat to Irondjinn for the sample. We could not keep it refrigerated. May have been better colder. Nice brown color.Apr 03, 2004', ""A 500 ml brown bottle pours a dark, rosewood, brown ale, with a creamy, medium-sized, ample, head, which leaves a delightful clinging lace. The appearance, in short, is superb. It is much more red than many brown ales I have tasted. The aroma is most appetising: gentle malt sweetness with aromatic, albeit slight, hop presence, as well as something I cannot quite describe...strange. There exists a really clean, invigorating, unprocessed smell--the way a fresh beer should smell. The taste does not disappoint the palate. Full-bodied. Lingering malt sensations and slight bitterness make this brew an ideal balance for a brown ale--by far the best of British Columbia's microbrewery brown ale offerings. The finish is definite chocolate and coffee, very similar to the aftertaste of a stout, but not quite. The sweetness of the beer initially is exceptionally balanced in the middle of the tongue; qualities which constitute an easily drinkable brew, complex enough to please discerning beer drinkers. It is, in my opinion, delicious, and will, I have no doubts, become a regular purchase of mine.Jan 28, 2004"", ""Mt. Begbie's Tall Timber poured a deep chestnut brown with a pillowy and creamy head that clung to the glass. It looks wonderful.I find aromas of toasty sweet malt and the slightest hint of something hoppy.Immediate caramel flavours blend into richer chocolate malt and a soft and rich finish of slightly roasty grain. There is the slightest amount of bitterness possible, I think, to keep this on track. This is what I want to be able to brew. It's smooth, creamy but light, and very easy to drink. Man, did I pick some great beers today or what?Dec 21, 2003"", 'Came in a 650ml brown bottle, my abv on it was 5.2%. Pours out a deep, clear walnut tone, but is a stunning cherry oak when held up to the light. Medium beige head which dissipates eventually to a thin ring. Aroma of roasted malts, coffee and nuttiness in there as well. Very faint floral hops hiding behind all of that. Flavour is of rich roasted malt and coffee with a full, satisfying mouthfeel. This is a nicely balanced, robust flavoured brown ale that does justice to this style.Nov 02, 2003', 'Medium brown color. Small white foamy head. Aroma is nutty and sweet, with a touch of chocolate. A medium bodied brown ale. Malts are nutty, choclately and sweet. Hops are slightly bitter. Nicely balanced. Mild tasting brown ale. Would make a nice session beer. Finish is a little sudden. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet.Oct 09, 2003', ""This beer resembles the nut brown heavier style than the mildstyle as it is chocolate and caramel flavoured in the mid body.The balance is complete with a good hop nose and a dark brown colouring. This beer is more of the sipping than session variety which makes it a great companion drink todessert or roasted meats.

There's a grassy (yeah yeah) note in there. The hemp essence is there. Not the skunky astringence of cannabis, but the nuttiness of roasted hemp seed, like one of those hemp seed energy bars. Weird, but it works. Taste is how it smells. Fairly true to the Kolsch style. Hemp seed oil is very apparent. No bitterness. Carbonation is a bit on the light side, but I'm stretching for something to criticize. Overall a nice session beer. The third beer is as drinkable as the 1st. An interesting but surprisingly unchallenging and highly drinkable offering from the brewery. I was a bit surprised however, seeing as how cannabis and hops are related and truly are similar in their aroma and flavour, that they didn't just use (industrial) hemp as a defacto replacement for hops, as that was basically what I was expecting them to do.

This style is a bit of a rarity when it comes to what western Canadian micros usually tackle and as an unabashed Lowenbrau fan I was intrigued. A pleasant goldenrod brassy color with a few white bubbles, this brew smells like good old prairie pilsener malt with a moderate dose of noble hop green spiciness. Popcorn and cracker malts and a little toast buttress some sour green fruit (gooseberry?) and crabapple notes, some cooked corn DMS flavor, and a little green vegetation from the hops. Not particularly assertive in the latter regard, however. Is that diacetyl as well? This one is quite sweet and sour in the finish, with a fair degree of carbonation. The final assessment? This actually reminds me a bit of a kolsch or even certain Czech pilseners in terms of the malt flavor profile and the presence of subtle fruit flavors that yield a rather cidery character.

Not to say there aren\'t stripes, there are many all plastered down the glass in pursuit of the white head that is sinking according to the alarmingly fast pace in which the beer is being consumed. \'Helles\' translates to \'light\' and indeed this clear bodied beer personifies its classification. Quintessential to a true Bavarian lager is a good dosing of prototypical German hops - I\'m happy to read Okanagan went with two traditional noble varieties: Hallertau and Saaz (even though the latter are grown in Bohemia, part of the modern day Czech Republic). Unfortunately, I don\'t actually smell all that much of them. This bottle is scarcely three months old so I doubt they could have faded that much. Then again, this is a Munich Helles and not a pilsner so it\'s not meant to be hoppy, it\'s meant to be malty. In that regard I\'m not disappointed in the least. These slightly sweet, almost grainy malts are just as quenching as they are tasty, if not more. Assertive bitterness, clean water and sufficient carbonation combine for a very enjoyably drinkable pale lager. The number 1516 in the name of the beer corresponds to the year in which Germany enacted the Reinheitsgebot (known in English as the ""Beer Purity Law""). This legislation dictated that a beer could only be made from the basic ingredients of water, barley, and hops. (Note that yeast wasn\'t discovered responsible for fermentation until the 19th century). It\'s only appropriate then that I read on the label that this is unpasteurized and contains no preservatives (the ""all natural"" statement I find a little dubious). More importantly, however, I don\'t actually taste any of the extracts or adjuncts that are so prominent in mainstream beers (including German ones) that have bastardized pale lagers. German Munich Helles don\'t really travel all that well. Part of this is specific to the style itself, but much of it has to do with the fact that most commercial examples that make it over here are so ridden with preservatives that they really taste like a ghost of their unpasteurized self. It\'s good to know now that some Canadian brewers have started to fill the gap.Mar 07, 2009', ""41ml bottle. I used to drink a lot of this back in the 90s, so it's always interesting to revisit an old standby on this site now.This beer pours a crystal clear, pale golden yellow hue, with two fingers of puffy, thinly foamy off-white head, which settles at a lazy, even pace, leaving some decent bonsai tree profile lace around the glass.It smells of grainy, lightly biscuity pale malt, a certain soup cracker character hard to shake, with a bit of hard water minerality, and very subtle earthy, leafy noble hops. The flavour starts with a decent bit of floral hop bite, before soon becoming awash in a bready, crackery, and yeasty pale malt graininess; a few more earthy, weedy hops play pile-on nearly after the fact. The carbonation is moderate for the most part, if a tad fizzy here and there, the body an adequate medium weight for the style, and generally quite smooth. It finishes off-dry, the varied bready malt carrying through, with a surprisingly peppy, edgy dry floral hoppiness along for the ride.A fairly pleasant, if a little tame, example of the style. I do now recall tiring of its one-dimensionality when sessioning it all those years ago, post-university, but overall it's a decent enough go-to, when you just want a well-made lager of Canadian provenance.Nov 28, 2008"", ""A Helles in Calgary? Alright...Pours a good golden color with a foamy head. Some lacing as well. A bit light in the nose, snappy hops and a little maltiness.

A bit sulphurous, too, which isn't unusual and not enough to be unpleasant. The taste was well balanced between bready malt and bitter hops.

This, the 1516, tastes quite similar to the Helles, so we will see if they both continue to exist. 1516 is a typical, but healthy and attractive looking pale lager. Light browns and golden straw, light honey colours. The head is definitely better than average, however. It poured with a perfect amount of head, neither overdone nor underdone. Off-white, thick, but fairly ephemeral, as it dissipates to a thin layer, the lace leaving thin serpentine patches. On a sweltering day, the appearance screams ""drink me."" The aroma is grainy, lightly toasted, with subtle tart milkiness like so many German lagers. Hops are well balanced, with some delicate spiciness and grass. Again, very German aroma, fittingly enough. The taste is brisk, refreshing, and thirst quenching. Good caramel malt up front, with a definite hop burst on the finish, leaving the mouth with a balanced, not overly sweet or dry feel. The freshness of the toasted malt is superb in this beer, roasted to perfection, a true credit to barley. Light butterscotch and even subtle lemon in the taste. The mouthfeel is high carbonation, light to medium bodied, and invigoratingly quenching. The drinkability, being neither offensive, strong, or heavy, is very good: an ideal summer brew; not to indicate, however, that this has little taste--on the contrary it is very flavourful. This is one beer I buy quite consistently; if I go out to buy a ""six-pack"" for a hot summer day, this usually is the standard. A credit to its name, 1516 is a natural refreshing German-style lager.Jul 18, 2004', '--regular brown bottle, no freshness date to be found.--Poured a very thin, clear golden color.

This is a decent enough lager, I'd buy it again for another patio/barbecuing session, especially in mixed company (macro drinkers, non-beer drinkers, and beer snobs alike) but I'd reserve it for hot weather refreshment, by no means would I make it a standard of mine.

It\'s been a staple of the Spring lineup for as long as I can remember. It looks fairly good, has a very faint aroma, and like many of OK Spring beers, is a bit thin in the mouth.

This pale ale is a coppery brown color with a decent amount of biege foam, maybe two or three inches upon initial pour. Aroma evokes some dark bread, musty grape, hints of citrus rind (mostly lemon). The malts are more assertive on the nose than the hops. Ditto on the palate. Initial taste is dark crust, some caramel, nut shells or old rancid walnut meat, dusty white peppercorn, lemon and watermelon rind but these are particularly subtle. There\'s a hint of hard candy fruitiness and some peppery spice but surprisingly little hop flavor for an APA. Rather tannic as well, with some grain husk emerging in the dryish finish. Highly carbonated and on the thin side for the style. I don\'t know, I am not sold on this one (or this brewery for that matter). It is too malty and in a coarse ""cheap lager"" way, and the hops are OK from an earthy bitterness standpoint but rather lacking in the flavor department.Mar 30, 2014', 'Okanagan Spring Pale Ale: Well, this beer missed the mark for me. I expect a bit of hops from a pale ale. I admit that may US pale ales are brewed in IPA territory, too hoppy. But still, I need some. The Okanagan has a dark color for a pale ale, a deep tan. Good head and little aroma round out the presentation. Nice malts up front and a clean finish, but where are the hops?

Light sweet caramel aroma with floral hop hints nothing to special extremely mild but pleasant. Light crisp taste some astringent but good, mild to weak malts are tasty just not enough power behind them. There is a bitter hop finish but with no real hop flavour, I guess I can taste some citrus in the after taste. Good light beer to sit back and drink if nothing better is around.Oct 12, 2012', 'Beer is a nice full copper brown, with strong carbonation and about two finger head, which is jut off-white. The nose is quite fruity, also picking up a lot of malt. Nice bit of kick, sort of light toffee apple. The taste has got a nice body of caramel malt, with apple fruitiness. Balance from the hops is alright, if understated. Drinks quite nicely, good flavour intensity but something feels like its missing. Mouthfeel is alright, mostly carbonation though. Some dry malts to the end. Generally light bodied, and the aftertaste is malty and a bit stale.Easy to drink, quite refreshing. Has some assets but could improve to make it more impressive, no glaring faults, and has a good amount of malty character to it.Jul 19, 2012', 'Pours a coppery colour, somewhere between amber and red.

Some cola carbonation from the sides, but mostly a nice streaming crawling pin head bubbles. Not bad.Nose is quite dry and bisquity. Fruity esters of slight cherry, with a good balance. Smells fairly inviting surprisingly.Palate mixes most of what is expected on the nose. Toasty malt body with classic ester fruit. Mouthfeel seem rather ordinary but tolerable, with about medium carbonation. Some density in the palate but big on yeast it seems.Overall this really reminds me more of an English style. It's alright you could do a lot worse.May 04, 2012"", 'Appearance - Pours a copper hue with a finger width of bubbly white head.Smell - Earthy hops, hint of lemon/citrus, slight nuttiness.Taste - Nice balance of earthy, fruity, and nutty flavours. Leaves a pleasant light bitterness on the palate.Mouthfeel - Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. A little watery, but still nice body.Overall - An enjoyable APA by Okanagan. I like that it is lightly hopped. Also quite enjoy the nutty hints of flavour. Not something I would drink sessionally, but still better than the macros out there.Apr 30, 2012', 'Not an inspiring ""American"" styled ale and without any hint of hops that I can discern, but would probably serve as a good gateway for a macro lager drinker into a world of better brewing / quality ingredients?Bright amber colour with decent head and lacing - looks appealing. Mouthfeel is light, but carbonation level pleasant. Aroma is uncomplicated and simply of sweet caramelized malts. This translates directly into the flavour, which doesn\'t have a lot of complexity either. Not a hint of a ""west coast"" or ""c"" hop to be found - more disappointing given the brewery\'s geographic location.Not a beer I’d purchase again unless choices were truly limited.Feb 03, 2012', 'One finger head in a pint glass, this is a copper amber brew with decent retantion and good lacing. It is relatively clear and a decent looking beer.The scent is malt and caramel and stale biscuit with little in the way of hops for the style.The taste follows the nose with some bitter hops coming through, light fruit, and mineral funk.Relatively light bodied with plenty of carbonation, there is a stale dry mouthfeel although it is still easy drinking. It really reminds me of a weak english pale ale or worse a lager. This is one of those brews that is better than the macro alteratives in a pinch but not worth seeking out with decent alternatives.Dec 09, 2011', ""A- Pours a copper color that is crystal clear and with lots of carbonation rising to the top of the glass. The head isn't super impressive, being about a finger thick at first, and settling fairly quick into a patchy ring over top the brew. The lacing looks very good, as lots of soapy bubbles cling to the glass, and stay there too!S- This smells very similar to an English Brown, with sweet toffee like malt goodness hitting the nose immediately...and the sweetness continues with some banana esters, and some other various dark fruit. Outside of this, I don't detect any hop presence that has any substance so a little disappointing in that regard.T- For an APA, I find this very sweet without any bittering balance. The primary flavor is all malt....gooey, caramel flavors with just a hint of bitterness at the end of the swallow....right on the back of the throat. I don't find the flavor offensive or anything, but I just don't feel that it represents what the style should be.M- The carbonation is plentiful and palate scrubbing. As far as the body goes, I'd put it right in between lite and medium, and probably lean it towards the medium side more. The aftertaste is what really makes this malty beer feel like I was eating melted toffee prior to this drink.O- Overall, I don't mind this beer, but I just don't think it represents the style well. I'd drink this again, but most likely will not buy it. Add some more hops to the recipe and I think we'd have a winner here, but I will say that this is nothing more than a slightly above average beer in a broad sense, but it doesn't stand out.Dec 06, 2011"", ""41ml bottle poured into pint glass 2/11/11A clear light copper with lots of bubbles feeding a short lived two finger cream colored head that laves a few patches of laceS fruity leafy hops and a little toffee, a slight metallic smell reminds me of a handful of pennies T not far from the smell but with a little rye bread and less metal, there's more toffee and its a little more earthy M medium bodied with lots of bubbles almost turning it to foam but just right, a slight aftertaste lingers faintly O basic but decent, not going to excite you in any way but easy enough to drink brings me back to my younger days when I could smell this stuff being brewed from my mothers house, it smells better after its been brewed but still not going to amaze youDec 02, 2011"", 'A: Pours clear golden body with some bubbly head and lacing.

It is definitely not the best pale ale on the market, but of the mainstream brands in my neck of the words, I still appreciate it and find it fully drinkable.Oct 25, 2011', 'This beer is becoming increasingly popular in western canada. It\'s now easy to find in almost any liquor store and many restaurants. One of the ""classic"" craft brews in this country. It\'s been a long while since I\'ve had it. It pours a transparent orange-amber colour. There is a goof amount of bubbles floating up to the top, culminating in a thing creamy-ish head. It\'s fairly standard looking, but in to way is that a bad thing.The aroma is warm and malty, though it ventures dangerously close to wet/grainy. there is some slightly fruity hops coming through too. Not bad at all.The flavour is slightly underwhelming. Slight toasty malts up front to start, it fades into some faint hoppy aroma that comes through as the malty notes become sweet. It finishes with some faint bitterness.Overall, I can see why this beer is so popular. Sadly, it seems to be because it is kind of inoffensive on all counts, while being slightly more of an adventure for people who are into Alexander Keith\'s, etc. I\'m not thrilled with this one, but maybe my expectations were too high.Sep 18, 2011', 'A - Pours a copper or dark gold colour. Bright. Mild carbonation. Half finger off white head fades to a cap fast. No lacing but the cap remains. S - Caramel, toffee, some gentle earthy hops. Fruity malts.T - Tobacco, some slight earthy hops, grain and caramel. A little soapy. Something seems unsettled. The aroma was much better. If this were listed as an English version of the style it would work, but as an American one it has too little hop character. Grainy and sweet for the most part.M - Decent carbonation with a medium body. No bitterness. Overly sweet I think. O/D - A miss for the style and not overly interesting either way.

Says it was first brewed in B.C. in \'89 and recommends a serving temperature of 9-11C.Nice honey-copper colour with a big tan head that leaves a moderate amount of lace and settles as a long-lasting collar.This really reminds me of the two 40-50s-style ales McAuslan from Montreal makes. Extra sweet, overripe fruits, toasted malts, a smoky woodiness. Sort of chalkiness. Honey comes through after warming.Quite sweet. Lots of malt with a decent dryness. Nice buttery note in the finish. Hoppy crispness/tartness comes through long after it warms. Definitely tastes best warm.Malty, yet crisp. fairly low in carbonation, but the long-lasting film creates a nice creaminess on the back-end.Would make a better modern red lager/amber than a ""pale ale"" that most people these days associate with a hop blowout, however this is a pleasant old-school North American take on the style. Maybe a bit pricey to be a regular, but could be a hit at dinner parties with less, but somewhat adventurous buddies tired of Kieth\'s.Jun 21, 2011', 'A: This beer looks more like an ale than a pale ale, it has a nice golden-brown colour.S: Hmm, something interesting is going on with the smell, it’s quite complex. I can make out malts, and maybe fruits.T: It tastes hoppy and fruity and it has a not-too-bitter aftertaste. Unfortunately, it tastes watered down, it would be excellent otherwise. M: It has a medium body and medium carbonation; it feels creamy and crisp.O: This is nothing horrible but nothing that great either. I would put it on par with macro “pale” ales, but it would be much much much better if it weren’t watered down. PS. How does this have a lower rating than Okanagan Spring’s 1516 Bavarian Lager? I disagree with everybody’s opinion but my own.Jun 13, 2011', 'Pours a deep amber with a thin white head, decent lacing.

A thin island of foam in the center fights a losing battle to maintain cohesion. Some lacing on the sides, but not much. Looks fairly heavily carbonated. Smell is very faint but otherwise ok; pale malts, light caramel sweetness, maybe some floral hops but that could be my imagination.Taste is nice but nothing exciting. Despite the fact that malts dominate the smell, there is an acceptable (if muted) hop presence throughout the sip. Grainy malts and faint caramel notes mix with this slight hoppy bitterness, which lingers for a bit in the finish. Earthy is a good way to describe the overall profile. Light to medium-bodied with a good bite from the carbonation. I like this, but as other reviewers have noted there is nothing Extra Special about it, which I suppose could be why it was removed from the name. The flavour could be described as both balanced and bland, and both adjectives are equally accurate. Worth one try; very sessionable, and potentially a good gateway beer, but will probably not impress serious beer geeks.[Updated Sept. 7 2015]I picked up a brewery sampler with 3 bottles of this inside it, and figured I'd give it a brief comment - I only seem to drink this beer every two years or so, anyway. This pale ale is not even remotely interesting, but it is inoffensive and easy to drink. I've updated this review a few times now and previously left the original score intact, but this beer just doesn't impress me these days. Mediocre, but still better than a lot of the pseudo-macro ales (Rickard's, Keith's, etc.), although I'd probably take any one of those AK single hop ales over this.Final Grade: 3.25, a C+.May 24, 2011"", 'a-pours a dark clear amber...very little head.s-citrus...malts....kinda thin though.t-hmmmm...some hoppy bitterness at the back of my throught.

When served to me the beer\'s head was inflated like a giant balloon. Like a balloon, it gradually lost its air, shriveled, and eventually contracted into nothing. That being the case, I\'m sure you\'ve figured out already that it was incapable of leaving any lacing behind. It\'s a positive sign that the brewery doesn\'t shy off the fact that their pale ale has a more hearty, more discernible maltiness than most its commercial competitors. The fruity esters and whiff of bitterness also suggest Okanagan doesn\'t subscribe to the ""if you can\'t beat \'em, join \'em"" motto. This doesn\'t have a ton of character - but at least it has some.This ale maintains its \'easy going-ness\' despite having a thicker, more bitter profile than probably any other beer you\'re likely to find on tap at a commercial establishment. The cereal graininess here is appreciable and wholesome - that alone makes this a good alternative to the ubiquitous macro offerings. Nevermind that it also tastes much better. Its bitterness may be practically anemic relative to many North American microbrewed pale ales, but it\'d probably be considered gargantuan by anyone acclimatized to mainstream lagers. Indeed, the fruity ale yeast esters and more enunciated hop bitterness are both present in the finish, which is significantly fuller than that of a lager. I\'m glad the brewery dropped ""extra special"" from the beer\'s name because, frankly, nothing about it is. It\'s a middle-of-the-road pale ale with no real faults but equally little character to match. It is a decent pint but unless you\'re the type accustomed to ordering plainer, more mainstream beers it\'s doubtful you\'ll care much for a second.Mar 08, 2011', ""A: Pours a clear copper with a fingers worth of white head.

The 'Extra Special' seems to have been dropped from the name of this beer, as of their most recently packaging update. That said, the new label has way too much stuff going on, as the different angles of text practically make me dizzy before even partaking in the product itself.This beer pours a clear, bright medium copper amber hue, with three fingers of puffy, foamy, and even a little creamy off-white head, which leaves some undulating streaks of cloudy lace around the glass as it quickly melts away. It smells of semi-sweet biscuit and caramel malts, some decent, yet muddled orchard fruitiness, and a wee bit of earthy, grassy, and leafy hops. The taste is more biscuit malt, a bit of removed bready caramel, faintly astringent apple cores, and surprisingly mild earthy, weedy hops. The carbonation is moderate, if a bit fizzy at times, the body a tame medium-light weight, and kind of blandly smooth. It finishes off-dry, with a bit more of that now dominant, yet still understated biscuity malt.Not a particularly full-flavoured pale ale, but enjoyable enough on a warm patio, in a much warmer season and locale, as the memory of this offering will stay in my mind, if not exactly so for now, and moving forward.Dec 28, 2009"", ""On tap at McGinnis FrontRow in Waterloo.

I am very surprised at the low score this beer has, but I think I know why.Okanagan Spring's Extra Special Pale Ale is very dependant on the medium it is consumed from. The on-tap stuff is quite literally terrible. It simply loses it's real taste, smell, and feel. Most noticeably, it inherits a sour yeasty taste.The canned version is also sub-par gaining a very slight metallic taste. Much more noticeable than other canned beers.

The taste shows some big fruity and bready caramel malt, earthy, but still hefty leafy hops, gritty cocoa beans, an ethereal lactic astringency, and some noticeable, but still well integrated booze warming. The smoothness of this puppy belies a veritable underlying fizzy carbonation, the body medium-heavy in weight, and fruity in its perceived density. It finishes well off-dry, the sweet 'n fruity malt pretending it's the only game in town, as the lingering nondescript hops struggle to stay above the rising alcohol tide.A pleasant, strong, malty, and high-test porter, which could certainly don another hat as a winter beer, and in the end, a significant step beyond the rest of OSB's overly approachable stable.

There is a roasty malty flacour, obviously, with a little bit of alcohol flavour as the beer goes down. Mouthfeel: This beer is quite pleasant on the tongue. Not overly carbonated as evidenced by the almost non existent head. It is a ""thick"" beer that is almost a meal in a glass.Drinkability: I have never really felt compelled to drink more than one of these in a night. The flavours are quite intense, leaving you quite satisfied after only one.Jan 11, 2007', ""I dug this beer out of the back of the fridge, I figure I've been sitting on it for somewhere around two years.

I guess I never did review it fresh.The beer is a deep dark brown colour, and it has a few floaties in the bottom now. A finger of tan head formed, and was fairly slow to recede.Aroma is molasses and black licorice, rum soaked raisins. Brings to mind an imperial stout, but I find the smell less sharp than the bigger stouts I've had. Nice.The taste is very nice. Time has created a very smooth sweet flavour. Caramel and dark chocolate come to mind, along with dark fruits and rum. Finishes a bit wet(if that makes sense), and holds a very slight alcohol burn.The mouthfeel is very smooth, carbonation is light and there is a thickness to it that reminds me of a heavier dopplebock more than a creamy porter.I certainly don't remember enjoying this beer as much when it was fresh.

Medium bodied, sweet and silky,.... palate floods with sweet figs, chicory, burnt treacle...slightly bittering finish. Hides it\'s alcohol well as a good Baltic should. Why the brewer labels this as ""old English"" porter is beyond me...this is a full ahead Baltic that will not disappoint.

Granted, this did not get terribly high ratings, but this is a poor example of a porter and an even poorer example of a baltic porter.It looks okay with a decent deep, almost black ruby colour, and even smells fairly decent. But the taste is (overly)roasted malts and not much else. And its sweet too, almost syrupy , which just doesn't sit right with me. Add to this a slick, oily feel on its way down and an 8.5% abv, and this is one brew that is palatable but not much else. The bet is which would make you sick first: the oily feel and sweetness or the abv?Jul 25, 2005"", ""This brewery is owned by Sleemans and is known for nice safe beers that scare no one. This beer is a holdover from when they first started and Michael Jackson used to call this one of his favourite New world porters. This is a beer that can't sell that much but is a great deal for lovers of heavy porters or stouts.The nose isn't much to speak off but the first sip is a nice mix of warming alcohol and dark malt. The coffee esters are not really apparent but a nice rummy fruit note is in place instead. This beer has a pleasant slightly sweet finish that makes this a good winter warmer for the same price as lager.Mar 24, 2004"", 'From a twist-cap bottle, this brew poured with a perfect sized, brown and red tinged head, but one which quickly disappeared to a minimal ring around the glass. Lacing was exceptional though: full screens that covered like paint. The colour is almost black, but is actually a very dark brown. A powerful alcohol smell pervades the aroma upon close inhalations, and I DO mean powerful, but there is also a pleasant, roasted, coffee odour; strong, burnt, malty. The aroma is also quite flowery, and nicely sweet, reminding me oddly enough of some dunkelweizens. The taste is thick, quite like a barley cereal; almost chewy! For my personal tastes, it is far too sweet, almost as if I am tasting the wort, not the finished beer! However, as the website says, it IS significantly hopped, and this CAN be detected in the finish(certainly not in the initial and middle stages on the palate!). The beer does not seem to balance itself as it should; indeed, it is only in the finish that the sweetness is complemented by the hops properly. Nevertheless, all considered, it IS rather flavourful, and I would call it ""almost"" complex, because of the inconsistency in the full taste from beginning to finish. I definitely could not consume more than 2 at a sitting due to the sweetness, however. Also, the generous 8.5% alcohol content may catch up to you!Dec 31, 2003', ""This porter is a thick black oil slick in appearance, mahogany highlights around the edges of the glass when held to the light. The thinnest of beige heads before it recedes to nothingness, even the surface looks oily. Aroma is robust, thick roasted malt, coffee and molasses upfront, then followed by earthy tones and a sourness that reminds me of lactose content, but which must be high alcohol content. Flavour packs a whallop, it's practically all the above mentioned characteristics, but seemingly all at once. Roasted and malty in the beginning, earthy molasses in the middle, boozy sour on the finish. Oily on the palate, it lacks a fuller-bodied mouthfeel. Still, this stuff gives me the impression of what porters might have been like back when they used to be blended ales, there seems to be a lot going on in this ale all at once.

The taste is crackery and bready pale malt, a more subtle caramel sweetness, some mixed pome and citrus fruitiness, fading earthy yeast notes, and more plain leafy, herbal, and grassy verdant hoppiness.The carbonation is fairly active in its poking and prodding frothiness, the body a decent middleweight, and generally smooth, nothing really milling about here that might cause any sort of interference patterns, as such.

Unfortunately, I wasn\'t.

Given that, it is indeed pretty much just a bit above average - drinkable, but not all that memorable.Mar 03, 2011"", ""A relatively aggressive pour yields a beer with a clear, dark red-ish amber colour with a 1 finger, soapy off-white head that dissipates quickly to a whispy film but leaves nothing in terms of lace.Smell is, interestingly enough, of light berry fruits (I get raspberry and strawberry) up front with a light touch of caramel malt and some metal.Taste is more adjunct than euro with a big hit of corn-y sweetness right away leading too an almost cloyingly sweet, brown sugar malt backbone. There is really nothing traceable in terms of hops or balance in this brew. The finish is sugary and metallic - not great to say the least.Mouthfeel is light in body with lots of carbonation but leaves quite and unpleasant sugary, oily texture on the finish and linger. Honestly, it kinda hurts my teeth.Because this beer is so sweet and unbalanced, its drinkability takes a major hit in my books. Really, the only thing of interest going on in this beer is the nose- but everything after that goes downhill. It's a sugar bomb.

There looks to be lots of carbonation, which is apparent from the head. It's not a real thick head, contains bigger bubbles and settles rather quickly, trapping large bubbles underneath. Some mild lacing clings to the side of my glass.S- Sweet smelling, with lots of caramel like malt. Once past this, there is some mild detectable metallic aromas. There are also some detectable light nut aromas mixed in with some grainy notes. I don't smell any hops to bitter the smell up.T- Some subtle malt sweetness, the aforementioned mild metallic notes come through on the palate, some grassy/grainy flavor and not enough hops pretty much round out the character of the flavors here. There isn't any lingering flavors after the swallow either, however, this tastes better than a standard lager....marginally.M- This is a thin, fairly watered down beer, even though this is being marketed as a dark mild (ale). The carbonation actually isn't as fizzy as I first thought it would be, providing a more creamy texture...unfortunately it doesn't have the body to go with it. Average at best.D- Oh yeah, this is definitely a drinkable beer. Somewhat bigger flavor than your standard lager, due to some darker malt being used. It's not overly filling, the carbonation is quite mild and it's cheap for a single here in AB....paid $1.95 for this can so not to bad....slightly less than your across the board macros.

Lager-ish smell, but lacking the skunkiness I tend to find in most of the lagers I drink.Taste is a bit stronger on the malts than your typical lager, and the hops are a bit more mellow. Definitely does not taste like your typical Euro lager. Malts with a good does of hops and a certain amount of nuttiness. Reminsicent of a hoppier nut brown ale. (I was always under the impression that ""dark mild"" was on older name for nut brown ale).A little thin, but perhaps this is due to it being a lager. Overall, quire drinkable.Apr 13, 2005', ""Tried this on-tap at a pub in Prince George, was told that this was the big local mainstay, like Big Rock's Traditional here in Calgary. My pint was served with a lime wedge on the lip of the glass, which I set to the side. Appearance was a rich amber/walnut tone, or so what I could make of it until the locals started looking at me funny as I held it up to the light. On the nose I was able to pick up light toasted malt and slight nuttiness, with the faintest hint of fresh grassy hops. The flavour is also mild, toasted malt and grassy hop balance, it has a rather watery mouthfeel that also contributes to the mild flavour experience. This is a very easy-drinking, unoffensive beer. I tried my next pint with the lime wedge which helped boost the hop balance a bit more. It's a pretty one-dimensional beer, so it didn't hurt the flavour profile at all, in fact it helped add a bit more character.Jun 05, 2004"", 'Presentation: 355ml can, boldly emblazoned with crossed Union JacksColour is deep amber, with nice clarity, but minimal head retention.

The taste is more weakly doughy and bready grain, underripe apple, the suggestion of a dalliance with corn sugar, a touch of diacetyl, and a mix of faintly bitter vegetal, grassy, and weedy hops.The carbonation is pretty underwhelming, barely a wan frothiness to be had, the body an adequate medium weight, mostly smooth, but with a little glycerol slickness. It finishes off-dry, the bready malt still strong, hardly crisp (so not 'beyond refreshing'), and fending off that fortunately fading vegetal astringency.A pretty average pilsener, if you can even call it that.

The taste is pretty consistent with the aroma, though a bit more thankfully restrained on the funky dank scale - with a muddled rain forest green bitterness, sassy underripe pineapple, blood orange, well-aged lemon and kiwi fruit esters, and more and more hops in the form of an herbal, weedy astringency, and a burgeoning boozy perfumed character.The bubbles are decently peppy in their quotidian fizziness, the body an adequate medium weight, and a bit too edgy (hops, they ain't infallible, amirite?) to be deemed particularly smooth. It finishes off-dry, the must-tinted tropical essence most prevalent, as the malt gets somewhat lost in the bitter and fruity morass.A more or less well doled-out west-coast IPA, one which squeezes the most south seas tropical goodness out of an all-American hop bill that it can - I'm surprised there's not at least a little New Zealand farm freshness in there somewhere.

Color was Deep Amber/Light Copper to Copper (SRM = > 13, < 17) with NE-quality clarity. Nose was super sweet, very much of caramel and roasted malt with a hint of salt. Mmm. Mouthfeel was medium. The taste was very much of salted caramel! I am not one for sweets of any stripe, as you know if you follow my reviews, but I do like salty & I have been known to pilfer salted caramels when they are available. They are two seemingly incongruous tastes that really work well together and they definitely do so in this beer. The site\'s Style Guide mentions a low bitterness, but I would say that it was non-existent in this one. It was sweet & salty, but that was about all. In fact, it did a great job of hiding its inherent alcohol, which could be dangerous in quantity. Finish was sweet, no getting around that, but it was pleasant, not at all cloying.

There is also a suggestion of mild fruitiness, slight hint of sea salt, and slight spice in the background.Still lots of malty goodness dominates the palate sensation with notes of rich caramel, toffee, chocolate, nuttiness, sweet candy, biscuit, bread, and brown sugar while sea salt adds some crisp and salty touch in the middle. Hop is muted with only just some faint fruitiness. The end and aftertaste is quite lasting with caramel sweetness and lightly toasted profile.Medium body with some crisp and low to medium carbonation through the palate, it is proper and enough to carry all the things well under smooth mouthfeel and dry finish.The best description to this is malt and malt and malt.

Very unique, intriguing.S: Thiiiiccckk caramel smell, scratch that, burnt caramel. Hints of honey and chocolateT: The thick caramel smell blends into a very balanced taste, a touch of sweet, due to the chocolate more than caramel imo.

The coppered complexion straddles the boundary between clear and hazy but is very vibrant. Its head, on the other hand, is shall we say much more \'dispirited\' and can\'t even be bothered to leave lace. Despite its name, Salty Scot is far from aggressive or boisterous. In fact, it\'s surprisingly shy on personality, especially in the aroma. Clean, concentrated maltiness is first and foremost (as it should be) and, caramelly notes notwithstanding, it doesn\'t smell especially sweet (nor should it) and yet, while stylistically solid, it leaves something to be desired...But I\'m hard-pressed to think of what\'s missing. The combination of crystal, Munich and chocolate malts ensures toasty, nutty undertones in addition to that crunchy caramel flavour. Sea salt, really only noticed on the finish, nonetheless compliments the sweetness in the aftertaste (and makes for a bit of a pretzel flavour). Again, from a technical standpoint, it\'s on point. Consider that Wee Heavy is a caramelly-sweet style to begin with - you\'d expect the addition of actual caramel to put things over the top. Fortunately, you\'d be mistaken. Credit to the brewer for using enough hops to prevent things from getting cloying or syrupy (cardinal sins for any style, especially this one). They\'ve done a marvelous job at hiding the 7.5% alcohol too. Parallel 49 may take Salty Scot away in the warmer months... but they\'ll never take OUR FREEDOM!!! Sorry, had to do it. Seriously though, this is a fine winter seasonal and, despite my initial presumption, isn\'t the least bit gimmicky. It may be geared more towards the general consumer and is hence a little ""tepid"" but it\'s still a worthwhile and well-brewed recipe.Oct 20, 2016', 'Pours a rich amber/caramel color with a light tan head. Leaves good lacing but not much carbonation. Drinking by itself brings out the sea saltiness. Pairing with salty snacks like nuts, chips or pretzels brings out the caramel flavor.

A very good appearance, quite true to style. Scents of caramel, chocolate. sweet berries, a light saltiness and hints of molasses. Overall impression of aroma is of an odd scotch ale, fruitier than many, but with caramel present as is usual. The saltiness is an interesting addition. Not as richly malty as it should be however, which is a demerit. Flavor begins malty with notes of caramel, molasses, and a noticeable berry presence and plum and dried fruit esters with an extremely light saltiness. Middle continues these flavors but adds a light bittersweet chocolate flavor. Finish is lightly dry with notes of lightly roasted malt and bittersweet chocolate coming to the fore, yet with the aforementioned flavors also still present in lower levels, and a slight touch of alcohol apparent. Aftertaste is light roasted malt, caramel, bready malt and light coffee. Overall impression of flavor is of a scotch ale, at a light level, with a bit of the advertised salt and a lot less malt than is typical for the style. Still quite nice. Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with light carbonation and a slightly thick feel with a smooth alcohol present. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a good light end scotch ale, true to form.

O: This beer doesn't seem to be as full in body compared to ther beers in the style, but this makes it comparatively easy to drink.May 17, 2014"", 'Pours a hazy orange-brown with a foamy beige head that fades to nothing. No lacing on the drink down. Smell is of malt, caramel syrup, caramel candy, and toffee aromas. Taste is much the same with toast, caramel, and toffee flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of earth bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a solid caramel and toffee presence that works quite well with the base beer.May 01, 2014', ""Parallel 49's Salty Scot, sea salted caramel Scotch ale. 7.5% ABVA: Nice, bright red amber color to it. Yellow in the dimple. Not much head. Barely any lacing, and what is there, doesn't hold.S: I am getting some caramel-ish notes, and just the faintest hint of salt. Some oak char. Molasses, perhaps. A touch of something spicy in the background (rye, perhaps?).T/MF: Hmm. It does have a caramel flavor, albeit a very dry one! Again, just the faintest hint of salt. You really have to search for it.

A deep reddish bronze or brown brew with a shocking lack of head. Upon pouring, I get a fleeting inch or so of whitish bubbles that disappear almost instantly. Scottish ales are not known for good head retention but this was nevertheless interesting. Aroma is rich and sweet, tons of toffee and dark fruit (raisin, date) and maybe a hint of citrus/piney hops (foreshadowing things to come). Palate was where this brew lost me a little. Immediate effect is burnt caramel and boozy apple/pear cider, with some vanilla and a vague salty presence coming through. The hops are leafy and resinous, making this brew rather medicinal and bitter for the style. Usually I dig Parallel 49\'s hoppy excesses but not so much here. Citric and fruity is the main sensory impression for me, although a pleasant malty smoke does build over time. Thin-bodied for a ""wee heavy"" and comes across as quite fizzy despite the absence of head. I guess all the gas lurks in the brew. Finishes wet, with a mixture of toffee, smoke, sour fruit, and pine. Final assessment is that there is some merit but I\'d pass on another opportunity. I am looking for a thicker mouthfeel and a richer sweetness with this style. This beer indeed malty but there are too many fruit and hop effects going on here that detract from the caramel flavors.Apr 05, 2014', 'Pours a reddish brown with a fluffy head and a lot of lacing.Smells sweet and malty, nutty, caramel Flavors follow the aroma pretty closely. Sweet Caramel up front, vanilla, almond and a little bit of salt, just barely there.Moderately carbonated, smooth full bodied mouthfeel.Overall, interesting take on a Scottish ale, not my favorite, a little too sweet but still a good brew.Mar 17, 2014', ""Poured a brown body with good head and lace with an aroma that is a little salty and dry but caramel, toffee and roasted malts come out. Taste is more sweet than aroma as sweet caramel seems to coat my tongue (the salt aspect is there I guess, but one could also describe it as a hint of toffee or bitter chocolate) and there's a smoothness to this beer as it's not light-bodied but goes down light-bodied all right. Not a complex beer but one that interests me as I've not had too many sweet beers like this. Not for everyone but I enjoyed my bottle.Feb 12, 2014"", ""Poured from the bottle into a Wee Heavy glass.A real nice red copper and quite clear body color.

Quite nice.Palate is a little bit light on flavor. Fleeting mid palate of wet toffee. Very thin watery body with not much coating or hints of malt thickness. Some soda like carbonation, and sugar candied cola like finishing power. Slightly fizzy also.Missing a lot of malt and toffee richness and thickness here. Says added with sea salt and caramel.

Our currently celebrated poet is semi-famous for saying: ""prudent, cautious self-control is wisdom\'s root."". Bah - didn\'t he ever let loose on a Friday night, especially one expressly set forth in his honour? Ok, maybe not.This beer pours a hazy, dark bronze amber hue, with two fingers of puffy, somewhat foamy ecru head, which leaves some bulbous arched instances of landform lace around the glass as it evenly sinks away.It smells of sweet, caramel/toffee malt, a subtle biscuity butterscotch character, some nutty pastry notes, a soft mineral essence, which I can safely purport to be of the specifically NaCl kind, and a bit of leafy, earthy hop bitters. The taste is more sweet pastry malt - bread, caramel, brown sugar, and that sneaky, barely perceptible salt addition that we very well know about, but do little to mitigate, a further restrained saccharine nutty essence, additional butterscotch notes, and quaintly understated dry leafy noble hops.The carbonation is quietly engaging, i.e., supportive, but nowhere near overtly noticeable, the body a hefty medium weight, and generally quite smooth. It finishes well on the sweet side, the mildly biscuity, ever more so pastry-dominated malt palpably asserting itself, so much so as to put forth a dessert-friendly air, tinged just enough with subtle alcohol and leafy hops to make for a generally well-balanced affair.I was expecting a whole lot more on the salty side of things, given the name and label info, but as it turns out, this is more of warning shot across our collective bows, for the inherent and insidious pleasant/unhealthy duality is just as imperceptible here as it is in our daily grocery-drone lives. Anyway, this is still a pretty tasty, albeit sweet Scottish-style ale, moderated by the aforementioned social conventions. Nix that - I suggest drinking this for its taste, and nothing else.Jan 25, 2013', ""Thanks to 4ster for this one.Poured from a 650ml. bottle (no freshness info) and split with my wife.Appearance: A respectable head rests on top of a reddish brown body that looks very vivid.

Manages to not be too sweet, if there's such a thing ;)Taste: Buttery caramel, more butterscotch. All starts from the middle to long after the sip. Mils wisps of peat.

That said, it came recommended and it was suggested it would be a good post dinner (dessert) beer which I found intriguing... As a Wee Heavy, I would say they've done a nice job with the style, and I would say they've taken a part of the Scottish Ale (slightly alcoholic/warming/sweet) and taken those characteristics and played on them by adding the sea salt which is noticeable, and turned this into a delicious dessert style beer not typical of this style. Everything is well balanced, making it not only easy drinking but making sure all the flavours stand out. I can see why people are giving cudos to this young brewery as they are already on the right track with a decent offering of beers out there. Worth trying, especially if you like Scotch Ales, and goes really well at this time of year....Dec 28, 2012"", 'Appearance - Pours a copper brown with a finger width of foamy cream-coloured head.Smell - Caramalt, plum, cherry, toffee, slight hazelnut.Taste - Caramalts and toffee take the lead and are well accompanied by the plum/cherry and hazelnut flavours.

My favourite part though is the subtle sea salt that comes through in the finish. I'll be honest, I didn't think salt in beer would work out but Parallel 49 used just enough to offset the sweetness of the caramel and add a unique flavour to the finish. M - Goes down smooth, nice medium carbonation.O - The caramel and sea salt are both present without being overbearing which is really nice coming from something that easily could've been a mediocre novelty beer.

This is one of those beers that is all about the added flavour, not about the beer. What I mean is, there is pretty much zero beer flavour here. The taste is entirely dominated by an out-of-this-world extremely delicious caramel flavour, with a slightly salted aftertaste. The caramel is rich and thick, with hints of maple, brown sugar, and plum. The finish is mostly where I taste the salt, and it pairs perfectly with the caramel. I suppose what is making me rave about this beer is the intensity of the flavour.

Slight warmth from the alcohol, though I wouldn't have thought it was this strong.M: Light residual sweetness with a slightly drying finish.O: Really well put-together novelty ale... it's not something I'd drink a lot of, but I'd be really happy to see this every season.Nov 25, 2012"", ""A: Hazy tawny tan with plenty of suspended sediment.

M: Leading off with a moderate level of carbonation, slightly light in the mouthfeel and I'd prefer something a little more syrup-y, only to hold onto that malty caramel flavours longer. O: Enjoyable and very drinkable, the caramel could have been overdone, however it manages to enhance and highlight the brew. The salty flavours are represented by the mineral notes, like adding a small amount of salt to water.Nov 18, 2012"", 'With 3 seasonal releases this winter ( all good as well) Parallel 49 is my choice for new brewery of the year. This is a classic wee heavy that has salted caramel added. The colour is on the lighter side for the style and the mouthfeel is lively and smooth.

This is the second bottle I\'ve cracked in the last two weeks.Pours a gorgeous, clear orange-amber colour; streams of effervescent bubbles race from the bottom of the glass to the surface, which is initially crowned with one finger of creamy, off white-tinged head. By the two minute mark it has mostly faded into oblivion, leaving behind a foamy, modest-sized collar surrounding a thin, patchy cap. Spicy notes of nutmeg, allspice and ginger snap on the nose, with pie crust and pumpkin pie filling overlapping with rich caramelized sugar from the Munich malt. Hints of vanilla and tea leafy hops.Quite well-crafted - sometimes these \'hybrid\' beers can turn out a bit muddled, but in this case, the pumpkin integrates beautifully with the underlying märzen backbone. Moderately sweet, with brown sugar and digestive biscuit flavours eventually being brushed aside by pie crust and pumpkin. The nutmeg really sticks out, with ginger and clove tying for second; the allspice and cinnamon are a bit more restrained, but still difficult to miss. The profile wraps itself up with hints of vanilla, leafy hops and earthy spice. Medium-light in body, with fairly mild carbonation that gently prickles the tongue and palate with each sip. Ridiculously drinkable for a pumpkin beer.Final Grade: 4.13, an A-. Schadenfreude is denoted a ""pumpkin oktoberfest,"" and I\'d have to say it delivers precisely what it advertises. This enticing fall seasonal pairs all of the clean, crisp, lightly sweet goodness of a märzen lager with the usual array of pumpkin pie spiciness, and the final product is an impressive fusion. I haven\'t had a boatload of beers from this BC brewer, but this one is definitely my new favourite P49 product - well worth trying if you have any interest in pumpkin beers, German-style amber lagers, or both.

Color was a deeply-hazy/lightly-cloudy Yellow-Gold (SRM = 4 -5). Nose was more citrusy than tropical, orange peel, tangerines, peaches, but the usual mango/guava/papaya suspects also showed up to the party. Meh. Mouthfeel was medium, but the haze also lent it a creaminess. The taste was really interesting in that it did not precisely match the nose. Instead, it actually had a citrusy bitterness & a pine-y mintiness as well as the sweetness noted on the nose. Bizarre. It was kind of a hazy NW-NE blend. I have to cop to liking it more than many that I have drank, reviewed & rated in recent memory, but I still felt unfulfilled. Finish was in that undefinable semi-sweet/semi-dry zone.

It\'s gone before I\'ve even placed the bottle down on the table - no lace or collar, with only a few foamy wisps on the surface. It pretty much looks like sparkling grapefruit juice. The aroma does little to convince me that I am drinking something that contains beer - again, it\'s nothing but grapefruit zest and juicy citrus pulp on the nose. OK, now I feel like I\'m just going to be repeating myself for the rest of this review - because it more or less tastes like a mixture of grapefruit soda and sanguine/blood orange. Moderately sweet and tart initially, with a touch of juicy orange flavour - however, the bitterness of the grapefruit pulp dominates much of the sip, leaving behind a pithy astringency that quickly fades in the aftertaste. Light-bodied, with lively carbonation levels - it feels fizzy and crisp on the palate, like a radler is supposed to - though the pulpiness makes this one feel a little fuller on the palate than most. Final Grade: 3.5, a B. Tricycle Grapefruit Radler is only 50% beer, but that fraction still seems a bit high by my estimates. I have had a lot of radlers over the past couple of months - many were worse than this, and only a handful of them were better. For what it is, this is not bad at all.

The taste is still grapefruit juice, yes-siree, but now with that certain sugar weight dragging it down, the sort of thing you get in the HFCS-riddled versions in the States, although now it's the grainy, bready, and wet crackery malt that's at fault - with some more weird leafy, musty hop bitterness that seems at odds with the acetic acid traipsing about my various palates.The carbonation is actually noticeable, as a lazy frothiness for a spell after a pour, the body a sturdy medium weight, due for the most part to the inherent fruitiness, and sort of smooth, the graininess toning down the most egregious tartness spikes. It finishes off-dry, the twin-sourced sweetness continuing its battle of attrition with the veritable froot joos.I haven't seen a beer that looked so much like its guest ingredients since those Bud Light Chelada deals a few years back. This is so very, very much better than that dreck, beyond the appearance, as the grapefruit juice just does its thing, forcing the base lager to assert itself, which it does to a minor degree, I suppose.

It finishes off-dry, a sturdy bready caramel malt watching the varied bittering agents stumble towards the exit like the old sots that they are.Despite what I've just written above, Persephone's IPA doesn't really come off all that bad, if you just don't look at it too closely, I suppose. Once I stopped caring about the metrics, sat back, and took another gulp - all was fine. So, yeah, this is the Big Bang Theory of the style, no apologies expected or forthcoming.Feb 15, 2016"", 'Got on trade during CANBIF thx westcoast! 650ml bottle served at 4deg C in a draught glass.A- Opens well and pours a 1"" high white head that lasts for a minute before film out.

Wow, it's nice to have an Oktoberfest brew, when, ya know, the actual Oktoberfest is going on - jawohl!This beer pours a clear, bright medium copper amber colour, with three zaftig fingers of puffy, loosely foamy, and somewhat fizzy off-white head, which leaves a bit of stringy and sudsy lace around the glass as it evenly retreats.It smells of bready and biscuity caramel malt, a hint of earthy smokiness, some rustic picnic table-top nuts, and plain leafy, floral, and grassy noble hop bitters. The taste is gritty and grainy caramel malt, an ephemeral free-range ashiness, wet breakfast biscuits, an oily nuttiness, some mild pome fruity notes, and more understated herbal, weedy, and floral hoppiness.The carbonation is fairly active in its palate-pinging frothiness, the body a solid middleweight, and generally smooth, with nothing really getting in the way of a rocking good time here. It finishes trending dry, the sneaky hop character showing the most lingering moxie.Overall - this comes off rather well in its attempt to emulate the real deal, with the biscuity malt, gentle off-setting bitterness, and just north of average alcohol content. Maybe I should have procured two of these, so that I could fill one of my dusty 1L steins, but I suppose I am just as happy with what I have left in front of me.

Simple, pleasant and sessionable.Dec 22, 2015', ""Blue Buck is a name that, for me, conjures thoughts of Canadian wilderness (outstretched skies and lakes, muscular wild deer) but the liquid itself looks very domesticated - figuratively and literally. The sterile cleanliness, polished highlights and pale amber colour characterize many commercial beers. The aroma has a biscuity maltiness, steely minerality, and pleasantly floral but lightly pungent hoppiness - all the telltale signs of a classic English Pale Ale. The people at the BJCP couldn't have drawn it up much better themselves. It smells like it was brewed some 7500 kilometers east from where it actually is. Far more mild (in every sense) than its typical West Coast counterparts, Blue Buck doesn't turn green or pink with dank tree serum or sharp citrus notes. But it does have an underlying hoppiness that is subtly fruity and adds appreciable tastes of bergamot as well as hints of marmalade and flower petals. These flavours pair wonderfully with the overarching maltiness and its butterscotch, biscuity, wafer-like characteristics. The smack of toffee sweetness only compounds the impression that this pale ale would be an acceptable alternative to afternoon tea. It would also make a sessionable cask at the pub too. Blue Buck is a mediocre beer but it's got everything I enjoy in an British-style pale ale. It's a good candidate to convert the mainstream beer drinker as it balances toothsome sweetness with agreeable hoppiness.

Good retention; it slowly dissipates over the next five minutes or so, settling down into a creamy, lumpy cap and collar accompanied by an uninterrupted curtain of lacing. On the nose, I am getting a mixture of toffee/honey sweetness, bready malts, some nutty notes and a few fruity undertones that include marmalade-y orange, red apple and apricot. This is an approachable pale ale - not entirely English in nature, but probably still closer to that end of the spectrum, versus the APA end. Bready malts, caramel and toffee, along with some lightly toasted, nutty flavours, characterize the front end of the sip. Mild hints of orchard fruit, such as apricot and apple, are next to come through, with a tinge of orange citrus soon overcome by a leafy, earthy bitterness that lasts through to the finish. Bittersweet aftertaste that encourages quick, successive sips. Light-medium in body, with relatively low carbonation levels that provide a touch of crispness - the overall feel on the palate, however, is fairly smooth, slick, and satisfying. Final Grade: 3.76, barely eking out a B+. Phillips refers to Blue Buck as a session ale, and it certainly is, at that. This is an unchallenging, enjoyable English-style pale ale that is clearly meant to be consumed in larger quantities than the two cans I picked up.

Hops are English (green, a bit earthy) but take a back seat to the fruit and malt. A little marmalade citrus in the uber-smooth mildly bitter black tea-like finish.

It's nice, but there's definitely something off in here.T - Caramel malt is much lighter than anticipated. Toffee like sweetness isn't very evident, in fact the malts in general here aren't nearly as sweet as I was hoping. The hop presence is still there but really subdued. Definitely some toasty grains working with the caramel malt, but there's still an off-putting cheap grain feel here. There's a bit of a nutty kick to it as well, but it doesn't do much to save the profile. M - Carbonation is quite nice here, and works well with the flavor present. The body is kept pretty light, but has a bit of thickness in it. D - Overall this ale is nothing special.

Overall it's pretty decent, but nothing special.Dec 06, 2010"", ""I love this stuff! I live in Seattle and have had it when I've gone to Victoria. Bard and Banker and Irish Times pubs both serve it on tap.I really like the flavor of malt and to me Blue Buck presents it as well as, or better than, any beer I've tasted. The hop level is just right too to balance it out. The level of carbonation is correct--not too gassy. And the color is right on for an English style pale ale.From my recent visit to Victoria I brought home a 6-pack of bottles. The beer is almost just as good in the bottle as it was on tap and the cardboard box type container is a great way to package beer.I wish I could get this beer in the Seattle area.Oct 13, 2010"", 'Bottle courtesy of IllNate, 341ml into a pint glass. Thanks Nathan!Pours a translucent golden amber, with a finger or two of white head settling to a collar; a few bubble remain. Some light citrus hops in the nose, some toffee malt and some grain and breadiness is evident. Taste is decent, some light hopping and nuts are here to before the malt takes over. More breadiness as well. Carbonation is quite high, almost fizzy at points and this detracts slightly. But this is Phillips\' proclaimed ""session ale"" and serves well in the drinkability department, easily sessionable and not too complex. Works for what it is.Sep 17, 2010', 'Okay, this is my first review, so be patient with me.A: Light copper amber color, slight carbonation, frothy white head that quickly dissipates.S: As soon as I opened the bottle, I was wafted with aromas of bread and a sweet toffee like scent.T: Not quite what I expected. A lot more malty, I definitely expected more hops. A lot of malt flavors, a bit of citrus on the finish. Has an interesting sweet, wheaty presence that ""sticks"" to the back of my mouth and tongue.M: A lot more watery than I like in a beer. The label says ""medium bodied"", I would say its leaning more toward the lighter side..but not overwhelmingly so. Carbonation level was just right, in my opinion.D: Definitely a session beer. I could easily drink this one all night. I\'d like to have it on tap and see the difference.Aug 21, 2010', ""This is a really good, light but tasty and well-balanced ale.Golden amber, it has a smallish off-white head quickly thinning to a ring and wisps. Aroma is light caramelly grain and bread with some faintly grassy-earthiness and a hint of honeyish apple. it's simple and light, but very pleasant.Taste is creamy caramelly-toasty grain and bread with light grassy hops with hint of earthiness. Flavour is mild and simple but well-balanced, consistent, and firm. It is somewhat reminiscent of a good cream ale, with almost lager-like charascter but also like some pale malty, less-hoppy examples of English pale ales. It is highly drinkable and satisfying despite the light, simple character.Aug 09, 2010"", ""A - clear bubbly light copper, short white head didn't last longS - very bready malt with some toasty hints, some earthy peat hops, light pepperinessT - toasty bread malts are balanced nicely by earthy leafy hop flavours, with some light citrus and pepper notesM - a little more carbonated that I like in an ale, but otherwise smooth fullness with a little bitterD - besides the carbonation, i find this to have a good flavour balance and a somewhat refreshing easy drinking quality, a worthy beerAug 08, 2010"", ""A - Pours a slightly hazy light golden colour with a caramel hue, thin layer of head which dissipates quickly leaving no real lacing.S - Sweet toffee malts come off the top, finishes with a clean whisp of citrus hops, some leafy greens also noticeable on this scent.T - This one is a little different than I expected, the leafy greens are quite noticeable on the flavour, followed by a mellow hop and the toffee malts. The flavour is rather mild, and I was expecting a little more, but still rather tasty. Bit of a wheaty finish that lingers on the tongue as well.M - This one doesn't appear overly carbonated, yet it fills the tongue on the swallow and makes for a nice full feel.D - This one is pretty tasty. Nothing spectacular, but a tasty beer nonetheless. I'd love to taste this fresh out of the keg to see if the flavours are enhanced. Easily a sessionable beer, and recommended for anyone looking for a lighter English Pale Ale offering.Aug 06, 2010"", ""1ml bottle, from slim pickings at a Kamloops cold beer and wine store on the way to some rustic rural BC summertime adventurin'.This beer pours a clear, slightly glassy medium golden amber hue, with one hefty finger of frothy, foamy off-white head, which renders some nicely splattered, broken webbed lace around the glass as it lazily melts away. It smells of sweet caramel, biscuity malt, a bit of fondant, some mild citrus rind, and herbal, grassy, and faintly piney hops. The taste is light bready, grainy malt, a touch of toffee sweetness, some middling citrus notes, and soft earthy, leafy hops. The carbonation is on the light side, the body a somewhat shallow medium weight, and decently smooth. It finishes off-dry, the malt swaying in a demure hoppy breeze.The marketing shtick professes this as Phillips' 'Session Ale', and I pretty much have to agree.

Simple. Good.This beer definitely lives up to the brewer\'s claim. This is an excellent session ale. It\'s super easy-drinking and has lots of simple, but effective, flavours and aromas floating around to make for a truly enjoyable experience that would satisfy any BA. I will be enjoying this brew for a long time to come! Kudos to the guys at Phillips for coming up with this one!Apr 19, 2010', 'Had a pint in Vancouver at the Morrisey Pub.Bright white foam, clear golden copper color. Good head retention with sticky lace. After a Coors Light (bought for me, not by me), the aroma was just what I was looking for. Bready, biscuity with floral hops. Bold but nothing over the top. Taste was bang on following the smell. Bready, toffee malt, fruity slightly grapefruit hops. Solid pale ale characteristics all around. Proper amount of carbonation (compared to the other fizzy yellow beers) give it a medium body. An easy drinker.Had a bottle from Phillips mixed case.Apr 19, 2010', ""Had this beer today for the first time in awhile, and I was not really very impressed. I personally always find myself being very sensitive to cooked vegetable, like corn which i found a bit of on this, both on the nose and palate. Pours nice enough, a somewhat rich straw type colour, little to no head.Get a lot of buttery cream corn type thing on the nose, with a little light nuttyness.Tastes again like butter cream corn to me with a slight dry nuttyness, not bad but not great, and not much my style or preferred taste. Mouth feel is good, medium weight and drinkable, definitely a good session beer for many (not me though).Probably wouldn't seek this out or really get excited about trying it again, but for an inexpensive session beer it's alright, although I expected more.Jun 19, 2009"", 'I reviewed the Blue Truck and remember it having quite a bit of hops. This seems to be more malt forward and darker. I like the big mouthfeel and the goodly use of malt makes seem like an Amber ale.

Revisiting this after being somewhat impressed in a blind tasting against other light-ish ales.Nothing of real note in the nose. Light caramel malts....Taste is easily on the light side. Buttery notes, caramel malts, the faintest of bittering hops (less than I remember from the bottle), biscuity. Thin body, carbonation is ok.Not as impressed as I remember being. This is one of Phillips ""for-the-masses"" beer (along with Slipstream) and while it\'s certainly drinkable, there\'s not enough here to purposefully bring me back.May 16, 2009', 'Bright white head floats atop a copper-gold color with remarkable clarity and healthy lace stickage.Aroma has a very English-y malt slant, some biscuit/bread, with the hops having a polite fruity character.Flavor?

Lightly buttery and a little toffee too, but generally simple and solid--no more, no less.Carbonated. Not overly so, but there\'s not much more to report. Just a tingly dance on the tongue with a light to medium body.Very much an easy drinker, but hardly outstanding.

Please be gentle.Electric Unicorn is a White IPA that pours a hazy golden/straw colour with a beautiful, thick white head. It didn't last long and as it dropped back, it left a little bit of a filigree onto the tulip shaped glass that I used. The light carbonation produced tiny bubbles that danced in the glass and brought this beer to life.I tasted notes of citrus, banana and stone fruit (maybe peach?) The bitterness of the floral hops work well with the other flavours. The citrus, fruity and pine smells are pleasant and not at all overbearing. Even though Electric Unicorn is 6.5% alc/vol., the alcohol doesn't overpower the overall taste like other IPAs that I have had.I feel that this would be a great beer to pair with a greasy cheeseburger or nachos. The flavours of the meat and the cheese would compliment this beer very well.Electric Unicorn also pairs well with the musical stylings of Mr. Steve Vai and his Flex-able album.

Regardless, Electric Unicorn does, at least visually, straddle both worlds; it has the pale yellow colour of a Witbier but doesn\'t look remotely like one given that its clear, sunny disposition is polar opposite to the style\'s characteristically clouded complexion. It does, however, share the moussy head and solid retention. An aroma heavy in orange peel is no surprise given that flavour is typical of both IPAs and witbiers; this perfumy, potpourri-like air is exactly the kind of thing I was anticipating. Other tropical fruits can be found in there too, pineapple and grapefruit being the most obvious two.It\'s not hard to tell this beer hails from the Pacific Northwest - the prominent weedy hoppiness in the flavour totally gives it away. While that pungency does factor into the taste it doesn\'t have the final word; an especially bright, almost candied citrus note buzzes around the finish like a relentless mosquito. Not that I expect the brewer to follow the instructions manual on a recipe like this, but a texture this creamy would suggest that unmalted wheat and/or oats, frequently used in witbiers, made the final cut. Good call. That creaminess helps recalibrate the mouthfeel given all that pithy, fruit peel bitterness. I\'ve had so-called ""White Stouts"" (that, by the way, like this, were technically yellow) which made me roll my eyes. A ""White IPA"", however, which combines zesty orange peel and pungent, fruity hops is actually a hybrid that makes sense. Electric Unicorn is a pretty good beer. In fact, the only criticism I have is of the term ""White IPA"" which, let\'s be honest, is silly but doesn\'t really matter anyhow.Jul 26, 2015', ""Bottle: Poured a hazy yellow color ale with a nice pure white foamy head with good retention. Aroma of citrusy hops with lightly sweet wheat malt notes is quite refreshing. Taste is a nice mix between some lightly sweet wheat malt notes with some citrusy hops notes which are well balanced against the malt bill. Body is pretty full for style with good carbonation. Doesn't’ re-write the rule book but very enjoyable nonetheless.Jul 15, 2015"", 'Not sure why this is categorized as a Belgian IPA when the label clearly says White IPA which would make it a wit with hops, not an IPA with Belgian yeast which seems to be what some people are expecting.Jul 11, 2015', ""0 mL bottle from the LCBO; best before Nov 27 2015 and served slightly chilled.Pours a cloudy, pale golden-yellow colour, capped off by nearly one inch of creamy, frothy, sparkling-white head. Decent retention; the head remains in place for five minutes or so, steadily seeping away until only a bubbly, filmy cap and wide, foamy collar remain - along with a nice swath of delicate lacing. The nose is comprised of an eclectic mixture of individual aromas - lemon pith and zesty orange peel, floral/spicy hops, apricot, pine needles, grainy wheat malts and mild phenolics. Smells appropriate, but not particularly aromatic, for the style. The flavour profile is quite approachable, with the white ale/witbier influences factoring in noticeably. Crackery, grainy malts and plenty of juicy orange citrus flavour get things started on the right foot, with some fruity, sugary background sweetness reminiscent of apricot and red apples. The citrus flavours take more of a lemony, pithy bent as you approach the finish, with floral, grassy bitterness dominating over all by the end. A touch spicy and yeasty in the aftertaste, with a suggestion of coriander. Medium-light in body, with assertive carbonation levels that aggressively agitate the palate, giving this beer a smooth, almost frothy feel in the mouth. I am not in love with this beer, but it has the thirst-quenching, refreshing quality of your typical witbier down pat, that's for sure. Final Grade: 3.77, a B+ grade. Phillips' Electric Unicorn White IPA is a perplexing hybrid. Though it leans toward the hoppy side, this one largely lacks the profoundly bitter punch that hopheads will be hoping for - and likewise, the witbier vibe that this one has may not immediately appeal to fans of more orthodox Belgian IPAs. Electric Unicorn is undeniably refreshing and pleasurable to drink, but this one simply lacks the authoritative gravitas of the best examples of this style.

Good to see another offering from this BC brewer in Ontario stores. Served cold into a pint glass.Appearance - slightly hazy with a rich golden color. Two and a half fingers of dense white head and a plethora of lace left behind in the glass. Tons of rising bubbles circulate towards the surface too.Smell - fragrant aroma of floral notes, some candi sugar and yeasty. Leafy hops overtop of everything give this a balanced if not terribly distinguishable aroma.Taste - pretty much like the nose some coriander and spice with wheat aspects followed by leafy hops. Candi sugar and yeast flavor doesn't shine through quite as much as the nose.Mouthfeel - smooth with soft carbonation, light body and easy to drink. Not a dry finish.Overall - a good if not great Belgian IPA, easy to enjoy and relatively drinkable for the style, however the combination isn't overwhelming.

Overall, definitely one of the more unique beers I\'ve had the chance to sample.Apr 18, 2015', 'Bomber poured into an English pint glass. Very light gold with a gorgeous creamy white head that retains its form well. Wonderful hop aroma, lychees, pineapple, muscat grapes, and tangerine with just a hint of spicy Belgian yeast. Hops lead the way on the nose. Taste features more of the yeast components, shortbread cookie, pears, coriander, and light clove, soda crackers, and reasonably bold hops that evoke tropical musky guava and perfumed lychees, pink grapefruit, fresh cut grass, lemon tea and just a whiff of spruce. Light bodied yet quite sweet, with a rather wet fruity hop finish that recalls grapefruit and orange smoothies. The Belgian character is certainly detectable but decidedly downplayed in favor of the American hops, and one can pick out quite a few flavors here. Rather brilliant summer IPA selection with more alcohol than a session brew (this might be rather deceptive ... ABV seems much lower, subjectively). Different flavor for Phillips in that the house yeast character is missing (different strain obviously) and the hops are tasty but not pungent. Not a criticism, as much as I do love Phillips IPAs.Jul 29, 2014', ""0 ml bottle purchased for $5.50 plus deposit at the BC Liquor Store.A: Slightly cloudy and straw-coloured, with an inch or a little less of white head.S: Slightly sweet, floral and citrus hints.

Maybe mixing an average wheat ale like a Hoegarden and an average IPA together would taste better? Doesn't get much for yeasts flavor, neither for hops. A little piny.

Like the flavours are annihilating each others while a great white IPA can be such a magical experience.The best thing about this beer is the label notes that inspired me to listen to Ozzy's first solo album.

That being said, I enjoyed this beer a lot more this year than last. Don't know if it's different or if its me. It pours a cloudy yellow gold with a nice fluffy white head. The aroma is hoppy, with a nice mix of citrusy hops and a yeasty, bready character. Fruity citrus, light sweet malt and estery yeastiness fill up the flavor. Hard to tell if any of the citrus is from actual citrus or from the hops, and the same goes for spices.Jun 01, 2013"", 'From a 650 ml brown bottle.

Compromises, me auld sons.This beer pours a very hazy, pale golden yellow straw hue, with two fingers of puffy, tightly foamy, and creamy off-white head, which settles rather slowly, eventually leaving some random sharp wave crest lace around the glass.It smells of somewhat tart orange rind, mild pale grainy malt, earthy Belgian yeast, softly spicy coriander, and a slowly growing bitter pine hoppiness. The taste is moderately sweet wheat grain, a subtle lemon citrus fruitiness, some weak earthy spiciness, throttled Low Countries yeast, and nicely even piney, leafy hops.The carbonation is soft, and generally quite yielding, the body a near full flag medium weight, and quite adequately smooth. It finishes off-dry, the sweetness of the wheat and barley malt bravely pushing through the now staid yeast and still weirdly IPA-worthy hops.I know that this is different from the majority of the previous Belgian IPAs that I have come across, in mostly one simple area - it isn't astringent, either via yeast, hop, or whatever.

My first impression was when poured it had a hoppy citrus smell with a very white head that held up very well. The taste was citrus first and then the hops build to a crescendo, I found it refreshing, light And enjoyable. #2 I added 2 oz of Clamato and added some Fat Chili Farms Wizard Choice Hot Sauce 4 to 8 drops depending on whether you enjoy spice, but the first one had 4 or 5 drops, I found my new West Coast drink, And now I live in Calgary and the Phillips Hop Boxes are available so I can enjoy here at home.

Pours a yellow to light orange with shockingly good head retention, that sucker sat there like a fortress for quite a while as I waited for the beer to warm up to a more ester-friendly temperature. Aroma was the expected west coast citrus, with grapefruit and orange leading the way followed by a dank marijuana herbal blast. Palate was actually quite devoid of citrus or tropical fruit, these are there in the form of some orange and grapefruit rind but take a decided back seat to tons of hemp oil, pine resin, tea, and leafy flavors that leave a major vegetal impression as opposed to fruit. Whoa. Maybe a whiff of white grape. Little in the way of sweet malt to provide balance, maybe a little nuttiness. Not bad if you are in the mood to drink a pot soda without the sweetness.

Definite cascade hop presence for sure. Bold and enticing. TASTE: Pale malts and melon sweetness up front, some grapefruit and hop bitterness at the swallow. Bold and lingering finish of hoppy cascade grapefruit, grassy bitterness and some melon sweetness as balance. Really nice. PALATE: Medium body and carbonation. Creamy on the palate, goes down smooth and finishes dry on the palate. Nice and creamy feel. OVERALL: This is really, really good. Really like the hop bill on this one, and it's really well balanced as well. Other reviewers might be expecting something different, but as far as standard IPA's go, this is a top-class effort.

Nose is a mix of bitter hops, sweet citrus (orange or tangerine), and a damp grain or earthiness. Intriguing. This is one IPA that really required about half the bottle for me to really ""get."" My initial reaction was less than pleased - rather than the crisp, tart citrus and grapefruit/resin notes I was expecting from a West Coast IPA, I got something sweeter and earthier. Someone described the brew as ""damp"", and that\'s about as good as I can do myself. Sweeter citrus (tangelo or mango), grass, earth, a mild muskiness, and a long bitter finish. It\'s growing on me. Zesty and bitter on the tongue, moderate to light bodied with zippy carbonation.Fortunately I have a whole sixer of this to work through because it\'s an IPA that deserves extra attention.

There is also some grapefruit and some grassy notes and a hint of an odd vegetable/corn husk flavour. It ends with a medium amount of bitter hop bitterness.Overall – Just a few small adjustments away from a really good beer. They've done a good job at capturing the hop essence and it shines through in the beer. But there are some odd vegetable flavours mixed in unfortunately. Still a beer well worth a repeat purchase.Mar 19, 2013"", 'I wish I could have said that Hop Circle IPA is a close encounter of the \'blurred\' kind, but this beer is clear as day. So clear is it, in fact, that you can observe each tiny bubble with precise definition as though they were under a microscope. The golden beer emits a brassy sheen and has a head as white and fluffy as sheepskin. What makes a good boxer is not only power but reach - the pungently grassy notes of this aroma reached my nose from across the table. So \'green\' and herbal, it feels like I set foot in a hydroponics grow-op (or the trees behind the high school parking lot). Luckily this weedy musk - read into that word however you wish - is undercut by tones of grated lime and spearmint. If I were desperate for Hop Circle and none was available, I could just as well lap-up the lawn after cutting it. Given, that won\'t relieve my thirst nearly as well but it would just about simulate the flavour. This has a seriously dank taste profile, one of wet leaves, flower petals and grass clippings, that drinks like a muggy summer afternoon (which, incidentally, may be the perfect occasion for such a quencher). There\'s more than enough tangy, lime-like acidity, ginger-type heat and lemongrass notes to keep things lively on the palate. Though I have yet to try any of these myself, I reckon the brewery\'s suggested pairings of curries, Caribbean patties, and spicy shrimp are innate accompaniments for what is ostensibly the beer equivalent to a Thai green-chili curry paste. ""Hoptimization capacitors activated. Taste probe functions optimal. Aroma sensors in overdrive. Engage."" So reads the label for Phillips Hop Circle, an IPA that certainly does \'abduct the hell out of your senses\' just as assuredly and brilliantly as its label describes. This is no hoax.

Smells clean and crisp, a cracker malt backbone decorated with Saaz-type floral/herbal perfume, clean yeast that has that unique Phillips character (hey, did they use ale yeast in here?), dry fragrant hay and grass. Smells like a really fresh and well-crafted brew from the old country. Briskly carbonated and with a thicker and chewier body than expected. The palate is sweet dough and crackers, tart green rhubarb and fresh salad greens, hints of licorice root, a dash of white pepper (although the herbs trump the spices here), copper pennies ...

The taste is pretty consistent with the aroma - enveloping biscuity and oaten malt, some musty tea-like notes, and a late-season, rather peppy wild grass hoppiness.The bubbles are pretty laid back, but not exactly lazy, the body comes across as a sturdy middleweight, and smooth, with more than a mere twinge of frothy creaminess.

Really typical lager aroma, without much depth or interest to it at all. Not even a bit grassy or bready, just some 2-row and subtle sweetness.T - Slightly more here than the aroma. The profile is dominated by simple barley malt, no surprise, but offers some mild grassiness in the finish. A touch of bready malt rounds out the flavor here. Not too bad for a lager. It's clean, crisp, and refreshing, and remains unoffensive throughout. M - Packs a bigger body than I expected, and certainly fills the mouth more than an average lager. In typical lager fashion, the carbonation here is higher than I generally like, but it doesn't get fizzy at any point. This is actually a pretty smooth beer, with a clean finish.D - Well, as far as lagers go this is about the best I've ever had. Just a clean and crisp tasting brew from start to finish, with a refreshing although simple profile. No off flavors, and no adjuncts detected.

I know Phillips calls it a Bohemian Lager but I think they intended it more in the German style. The beer poured in a nice golden yellow colour smelling of fruity malts and a touch of yeast. The taste had an initial sweetness paired with toast notes. Then there was a watery dryness, some citrus and apples.

The taste is quite bitter, with the metallic aroma translating to the taste as well. Leaves a bitter taste on the back of the tongue. surprisingly, this has a great mouthfeel. Lighter carbonation than your cheap macro swill means it is easy on the old tastebuds. Because of the metallic taste and smell, I don't think I'll buy it again.

Tropical fruits dominate the remaining nose: mango, kiwi, orange, and melon.TASTE / MOUTHFEEL: A very light mouthfeel with what feels like little to no carbonation is on the palate. This IPA is lacking a much needed intense citrus bitterness. More of a sweet malt taste comes forward with hints of citrus rind. No real excitementin the beer whatsoever. Easy drinking, simple with muted flavours that should be shining and bold.OVERALL: Return to sender! A beer that should make me want to be in British Columbia while I drink it, failed.

The ""West Coast Pale Ale"" name on the can did not seem to match this pleasant beer to the point I went to Postmark\'s website. Both the malt and hop bills are very much continental, but this used an American ale yeast. They insist there ""Think West Coast in a glass"", so I\'m baffled as to whether this is a West Coast British Columbia style. There is a very slight citrus and fruit note to the finish that would be appropriate to an American yeast, but to me this is a classic robust bitter or English IPA. And I say that without disappointment, because I like the style very much and as such, this is a fine example. I\'m rating it to enjoyment, rather than the American pale ale style, which I\'m not sure was intended. Recommended to those who enjoy a malty, moderately hopped pale ale.Oct 06, 2017', ""Another solid offering from Postmark. This is a very serviceable pale ale - malt forward, with just enough hop bite to remind you of the style. It's a nice looking , light colored ale.

Slightly doughy, yeasty, maybe even milky? Much maltier on the taste than I initially expected (both from the smell and the ""west coast"" designation): lots of biscuit, some cracker, slight toasted malt character. And then a slight hop presence: less citrusy than the nose, more of the piney, dank resiny character. Fairly dry, astringent aftertaste and a slight metallic twang.

The taste is grainy, bready pale malt, a waning caramel sweetness, a thankfully more assertive wet pine needle acridity, some middling domestic citrus rind, further indistinct yeast notes, and plain herbal, grassy hops.The carbonation is generally mild and unassertive in its mostly benign frothiness, the body on the low side of any sort of true middleweight, and not particularly smooth, as the inherent hops, so blase about their contributions in the flavour department, misdirect their sass inwards. It finishes trending dry, the hops tamping down any lingering malt aspirations.I don't what it is about this one, as it isn't bad, per se, but it kind of leaves me feeling disjointed about my perceptions of what a pale ale should be. Bitter, sure, but not in the tasty, god dammit gimme some more vein, but in a clear the room, this party's so over sort of sense.

It finishes off-dry, that robust malt re-asserting itself, amongst flailing hops and yeast alike.Overall, the 'whitening' of this IPA is subtle, at best, but enough to indicate that this isn't a simple West Coast new hop combo wankfest - we got our proprietary yeast too, yo! Whatever, the fruit flavours are heady, but don't exactly break through, and the overall effect is less IPA, and more Belgian Pale Ale.

At some angles, it looks like I poured a stout, and some angles (with bright light behind it), you can see the dark reddish-tan colour of the beer.On first sip, my smelling senses confirmed the tastes.

Ample, bubbly, light tan head falls steadily but gradually. Clear mahogany with bright red highlights when backlit. Very active, and leaves some scraps of lacing. Mild roast, strongish booze that burns a little. It has an earthy character, and malty sweetness is difficult to find. Not as smoothly balanced as the taste.Mildly roasty and just a bit peaty. I can just barely detect some booze, and there is a surprisingly medium bitterness underlying it all. It's good. Well carbonated, medium body, slightly viscous, and with a biter and dry finish. Feels kind of thin.This is a good beer. The nose is a bit too boozy, and it's more bitter and less malty, with less body, than I'd like.

It smells of slightly toasted caramel/toffee malt, a bit of wet ash, ethereal dry cocoa, and weedy, grassy hops. The taste is bready, sort of grainy caramel malt, mild biscuity toffee, a suggestion of smoked peat, and dry, musty leafy, and earthy hops. The extra point and a half of ABV is not noticeable in the least. The carbonation is moderate (if a wee bit spritzy), the body a decent medium weight, smooth, somewhat unctuous, and pleasantly coating.

Gentle cinnamon and clove as the beer warms. A very subtle hint of sweetness is well tempered by a controlled and gentle bitterness that is perfect for the style. Storm's Scottish Ale is far too sweet; this beer does not make the same mistake. This really does taste like it is brewed in the UK, perhaps like a nuttier version of Wells Bombardier.Mouthfeel: Medium to full bodied, some carbonation, chewy.

There is plenty of malt in this beer but it is not in your face or overly sweet as some wee heavies have been.

Pours a thin head made of mixed bubble sizes which quickly dropped down to a thin, patchy skiff. Low rate flow of tiny bubbles from the bottom and the side of the glass. No lacing.The scent is a mix of light malt, yeast, and some mild green vegetable I couldn't place. There is also a faint sweet scent. Swirling the glass kicked up a more robust malt, more of the green vegetable, and a hint of barnyard. This smells both more robust and a little dirtier than a typical lager.Started slightly sweet with the green vegetable showing up, and then a very nice light malt kept coming in waves. Much cleaner taste than expected from the smell. Tastes more robust than a typical lager. The aftertaste is mostly the malt and the light barnyard shows up again for a few seconds. Not quite true to the style, but the stronger malt is a pleasant diversion from the stock character.Quickly turns into a creamy foam. This is not expected given the visual low carbonation. The cream turns into larger bubbles that cause a very light tongue tingling. Medium-light body.This has wandered a little too far from the traditional style, but that isn't a bad thing. The more robust flavor and feel is more like kölsch than lager. This difference from standard becomes more obvious as it warms up and opens into very ale flavor territory.

Easy drinking and unoffensive.Apr 28, 2012"", ""Spinnakers IPA is awfully fair and frail looking for something supposedly modeled after beers that survived the unfavorable, several rough months long journey from England to India. Going on appearance, there ain't no way this one would have survived the trip! It hardly looks like it survived the voyage from British Columbia to Ontario: it's flat, filmy and dull. The aroma, fortunately, shows some sign of life. The scent of toasted biscuits reassures me that some malt was used and a faint floral fragrance does likewise for hops. Any way it's sliced, however, this bouquet (and indeed the beer) comes up lacking in every regard. Even for a self-affirmed mild mannered example of the style, this is no great shakes. If, as a homebrewer, you happen to have tasted un-hopped and/or unfermented wort you know how plain and often genuinely grainy a beer can taste. This tastes kind of like that. Despite a slight earthiness (which honestly comes across as little more than an afterthought) this beer is plainly cereal-y - not my first choice of flavour when drinking a beer. This IPA is only as hoppy as the North Koreans are free. Sorry Spinnakers, but double-check your math - that calculation of 55 IBU has to be way off (and, to be fair, so too does the 7% alcohol claim). Those may not be such bad things as far as the conventional customer is concerned, but anyone who knows what to expect from an IPA is sure to be disappointed. If the brewery wants to keep doing an IPA I highly suggest they do some soul searching on this issue - their current offering leaves much to be desired and really leaves nowhere to go except up, especially considering it's brewed so near one of the world's great hop growing regions. I get that it's meant to be an ode to the British offerings, but that requires more than just harder water minerals... I suspect even U.K. brewers would find this lacking.Jun 30, 2011"", 'Spinnakers IPA pours a bright gold with a thin head that fades quickly. Citrusy, herbal and earthy hops pop up in the aroma, with a nice light caramel maltiness. The flavor is nicely balanced, with plenty of sweet malt, and some light, citrus and herbal hops. The bitterness is moderate, and nicely balanced.Mar 12, 2011', ""This IPA pours a light orange yellow with a bubbly, frothy white head that dissipates to a bubbly foam and leaves a bit of patchy lacing on my glass.Smell is predominantly malty with good hints of honey, brown sugar and bread. Not a whole lot in the way of hops though with is disappointing for a West coast IPA. Taste is, again, much more malty than hoppy with flavours of honey, caramel and bread and just a very slight hint of bitter hoppiness in the background. Really, the hops don't add much to this beer in terms of bittermess. In fact, they give more of a sour flavour to the brew. The finish is dry with bready and very slight hop notes lingering on.Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with a medium level of carbonation and a slightly oily finish.This beer's 7.1% ABV is hidden quite well despite its relatively weak flavour profile. This is likely its best quality as I could see myself polishing off a couple of these without any problem at all. However, it just doesn't deliver the hoppy flavour that a good IPA should. Thus, if I were in the mood for an IPA, I would not consider buying this beer again. This is more of a simple pale ale to me.Jul 11, 2010"", '50mL bottle.

The taste is gritty and grainy pale malt, a muddled berry and citrus fruitiness, some oily bar-top nuts, and more well-understated earthy, musty, and dead floral hoppiness.The carbonation is quite active in its palate-probing frothiness, the body a so-so medium weight, and mostly smooth, but for a touch of fruit acidity weirdly getting in the way of an ideal time at this point in the game. It finishes off-dry, the malt and fading frooty essences presiding.Overall - okay, as far as using raspberry and citrus in a winter brew, I suppose that they were going for a simulacrum of the various fruitcake or chocolate-covered whatevers that abound from now until the snow thinks about starting to melt.

Wet grass with malt biscuit undertones and a trace of piney hops? Dunno. Color is a soothing gold/straw hue with evident, albeit, minimal carbonation even 10 minutes after the pour which I was impressed with. Upon the pour one finger head with a pleasing clean white foam that does however, unfortunately, dissipate sooner than I'd like. Mouthfeel is clean but with a tad of watery undertones. Carbonation is sharp and works well with the gentle hops/citrus/biscuit flavor profile. Is this a hot, summer weather, dry throat quench type of beer? Yes, all day, every day, no questions asked. Is this an evening in front of the TV with fave movie and snacks at hand type of beer? Ditto. Poured properly, this beer is easy on the eyes and will wet the proverbial whistle with above average taste, looks and flavor profile.

There was a bit left in the bottle so I poured from a bit of a height -- the head overspilled the glass, and then I felt the beer was a bit flat. Oddly it felt much better after leaving it stand a minute.This is a very light beer, really easy to drink -- there is a hint of oiliness to it, but nothing off-putting about that.T: Taste is hops, citrus: a little lemony, with a nice amount of orange/marmalade/peel. The rest just carries this through (there's no other strong characteristics) yet it does it so nicely. There is some bitterness in the middle and towards the finish, but it fades out.

Nah. Not when the result is two-plus fingers of foamy, puffy, bone-white head with good retention. Color was Straw-Yellow (SRM = > 2, < 4) with NE-quality clarity. Nose was laden with Saaz hops and now my mouth was watering. I do not mind German Pilsners, as such, but I will eschew them in favor of Czech Pilsners when they are available. Mouthfeel was soft, caressing my poor, bruised tongue. The taste was clean, grassy, Saaz-driven with a hint of biscuit malt lurking in the background where it belongs. I just looked at the list of hops on the CAN and it is impressive! The more of it that I drank, the more I reveled in its clean taste and unwavering hoppiness.As a hophead, this was my idea of a nightcap.

Light gold with a moderate amount of creamy, slightly fluffy white head. Particularly sweet fruity aroma: Apricot and strawberry notes, honey, hay, grape skins, white bread, hints of lavender, musty vanilla bean. Dare I say the aroma is almost too sweet and lacking in the expected floral/spice elements, although these lurk in the background. Palate is similarly full of berry and pear flavors, although there is a pleasant crispness in the finish, where the expected grassy hop notes finally emerge. The hop bill listed on the bottle seems wicked in principle but in practice I'm not so sure for this style. Saphir is fruity for a German bloodline and that cider-like sweetness from the nose carries through right until the end, where one expects more of a palate cleanser. The residual sweetness fits the Czech style although the body is too thin and the malts are subdued. I am getting more spice and herb notes late. Unique pilsner and I can see the appeal. I'd look for a more classic take on this style.Oct 09, 2014"", ""355 mL bottle from a BC Craft Brewers Guild sampler picked up at the LCBO; no apparent freshness info. This brewery has some awesome label art. Served well-chilled.Pours a clear golden-yellow colour, crowned with one finger of frothy, white head which soon recedes. In its place, a soapy cap and collar remain, in addition to a few swaths of lacing. Nice aroma - grainy pilsner malt, crackers, lemon and grassy hops. Definitely reminiscent of some of my favourite Czech-made lagers so far, but how does it taste?The answer? Superb - this is just an excellent pale lager. The flavour profile is delicately balanced, with grainy pale malts and doughy sweetness starting things off, and the enjoyable noble hop bill finishing things off. Very grassy, with lots of lemon zest and some lightly earthy notes that offer a mildly bitter finish that lingers briefly into the aftertaste. This is a light-bodied beer, with heavy carbonation that prickles the tongue and provides a crisp, refreshing mouthfeel. This lager is a pleasure to drink, and I wish I had more than one bottle so I could test its sessionability. Yeah, that's the ticket...Final Grade: 4.1, an excellent A-. I've had only a handful of domestic-made Czech pilseners, but Steamworks' Pilsner is one of the best. This is an approachable, well-made, highly quaffable pale lager that beer geeks and macro lager fans can enjoy equally, leaving the majority of 'craft lagers' behind in the dust. Absolutely worth a shot, and a worthy inclusion in this sampler pack. I'd drink this regularly if it were available locally.Aug 13, 2014"", ""12oz Bottle from the Ottawa LCBO for $2 or soAppearance - Clear gold/yellow colour with an average size fizzy and frothy white coloured head.

I can taste grains and lemons mixed with malts and some corn. There are also some hops and a cracker flavour. Overall – Refreshing and crisp, and not a whole lot of adjunct flavour. A great summer beer and something I'd drink again on a hot day.Aug 07, 2014"", ""5ml bottle (odd, that). It's been a long while since I spent a cool (for Vancouver) late November evening drinking at this place near Gastown, watching the Heritage Classic occurring back in my hometown, where this brewery's offerings are now available.This beer pours a clear, pale golden straw colour, with three fingers of puffy, loosely foamy, and bubbly off-white head, which leaves some random ocean spray lace around the glass as it evenly subsides.It smells of warm, crackery and bready pale malt, a bit of baker's yeast, a hint of petrol, and earthy, grassy, and hay-like hops. The taste is gritty, doughy pale malt, wet saltines, a soft lemon citrus kiss, and a rather peppy grassy, leafy, and earthy noble hop bitterness.The bubbles are active enough in their basic support duties, with a wee extra frothiness for good measure, the body just on the light side of medium weight, and generally smooth, the hops here not of an invasive or prickly nature. It finishes off-dry, the graininess sticking up for itself through the end.Steamworks' Pils is clean, crisp, and does a stellar job aping the better Bohemian offerings. Easy to drink, especially if you're a fan of the style (points both thumbs at self) - I would not have been the least bit sad had I actually procured a sixer of this, rather than the single. Oh, and it's Heritage Day today - this review has apparently come full circle, in a way.Aug 04, 2014"", ""I haven't tried many beers from Steamworks, which is kind of a shame.

I can't fault the beer for being what it's supposed to be.F: I'd like it to be just a little more crisp.O: Although I don't personally really like this beer tat much, it is, as far as I can tell, a well executed example of the style.May 24, 2014"", 'A: 1/4"" white head that leaves a nice lacing over clear golden straw liquid.

Aspirin in the finish as it warms. At 30 IBUs, this isn\'t your grand daddy\'s Old Style.M: A smooth and somewhat creamy medium viscosity and a medium level of very fine carbonation. Some drying.O: Aside from Sixpoint\'s Sehr The Crisp and Victory Prima Pils, this is one of the best pilseners I have ever had. The usage of magnum hops as a bittering hop really helped out the traditional noble hops at the back end.

Lingers in the mouth with hoppy crispness. M: Light and crisp in the mouth, clean and refreshing. O: Its a great clean refreshing pils, light and crisp. Easy to drink and easy to match with a simple meal like pizza and salad.

So glad to be able to get this excellent pilsner in bottles (6-packs) now. It was always a favourite at the Great Canadian Beer Festival. It pours a bright yellow with a nice tuft of white head.

Very crisp and drinkable.Sep 24, 2012', 'Had on tap at the Steamworks Brew Pub in Vancouver, BC. This was an awesome pub inside a very interesting city. The pub atmosphere was a nice restaurant upstairs, and then down a spiral staircase downstairs is a dungeon-like brew pub. Very awesome.A: Nice, clear yellow with a frothy white head. Looks very quenching after walking six to seven miles around the city. Nice head that lasts and laces pretty well.S: The smell is awesome Saaz hops, very spicy, super grainy with fresh Pilsner malts, and fresh cut grass. One of the best smelling Pilsners I have had. Also, nice and skunky (in a good skunky hop way).T: Incredibly well done. The grass profile is stunning, and blends so nicely with the fresh grains. A very nice skunky bitter pine hop profile really sets this beer apart from other Pilsners, and the abundance of hops makes this one of the best I have had.Overall, this was one of the best Czech Pilsners I have had. I would put this right up there with Prima Pils for the best Euro Pilsners I have had. Just awesome.Aug 10, 2011', ""I am transcribing this from notes that I took last summer. Poured on-tap at the Steamworks Brewing Pub in Vancouver, BC, it was served in a pint glass. Bright, vibrant gold coloring with no head to speak of. I was impressed by the look as it didn't appear watery to me like a lot of Pilsners do. The beer had only a slight aroma, and it was a little hoppy. The flavors are crisp and extremely light, with only hints of flowers, hops, and roasted malt characteristics. Although all the flavors are light, they blend together very well and come of particularly well. The beer is not nearly as bitter as some Pilsners come off. The finish is crisp, and there is not an aftertaste at all. Extremely easy to drink, although there are tastier brews out there.

The taste is sharp cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger spice right off the top, with a near equally strong toasted pumpkin guts vegetal thing, some further grainy caramel malt, baked brown sugar, and an indistinct earthy dryness - maybe some pepper dust, maybe some alcohol.The bubbles are generally quite competent in their demanding supportive duties here, rendering a solid frothiness that engenders a more or less smooth mouthfeel, to go along with a solid middleweight body. It finishes off-dry, the pumpkin and its attending spices keeping the party going well past dessert.A very well-rounded and impressively structured pumpkin ale, as the fleshiness of the pumpkin barely wavers, and the spices stay on for the whole ride.

Another thing that surprised me was it's relative light bodied mouthfeel. And many of you know my love for Steamworks bottle designs and this takes it an extra step by making the bottle Glow-In-The-Dark. Great beer all aroundDec 22, 2014"", ""650 ml bottle served cool into a pint glass. Purchased from LCBO for $5.95 CDN.Appearance - bronze coloured, crystal clear with a half finger of white head. The head dissipates quickly leaving a small ring of froth around the edge of the glass.Smell - pumpkin with some spices, namely cinnamon come to mind. Definitely pumpkin pie, like although the buttery crust is missing. Nose isn't too potent.Taste - pumpkin dominates with an early fullness contrasted with a mild bitterness. Spices abound but have a fine subtle ness to them. Cinnamon and nutmeg are the stars of the spices.Mouthfeel - smooth a touch syrupy, but the carbonation cuts through to make it enjoyable. Heavier than average finish.Overall - well crafted pumpkin ale, certainly worth a try. My only knock is that while enjoyable there wasn't nothing that really stood out from the pack ut really solid all around.Nov 12, 2014"", ""650 mL bottle from the LCBO. Poured into a tulip glass, a clear caramel orange colour, fairly slight on the film and lacing.S - aroma has a fresh pumpkin pie note, ginger, fresh roasty pumpkin notes, with a biscuity character, gentle hop spice, mostly complimenting the cinnamon and nutmeg notes, altogether a nice pumpkin pie aroma.T - similar onto the taste but a bit less vibrant, at least initially, start is mostly malty, some caramel and cereally, before more of the dry spices come in and some of the pumpkin notes start to get picked up, it has a dry pumpkin pie character, with a subdued baking character, that is generally earthy and dry spicy. This has some nice flavour but it doesn't really jump out at you and mostly stays on the back end. Taste is pretty well balanced but I wouldn't say its overly complex, an interesting melange of the spice and fresh biscuity notes leads to an interesting profile though.M - this was fine, a moderate body, maybe a bit more pronounced with the strength and the spicing. Gets dry and slightly astringent to the finish. Carbonation is moderate.A good but somewhat underwhelming pumpkin ale. Maybe my expectations were set high on this but it didn't display anything too exemplary but it was a really nice balance of a few key ingredients. It is a decent pumpkin ale, with some of the pumpkin retained behind the spices, which are dominant but at least not overwhelming, and combine with a nice toasty malt base to provide an overall warming fall ale. Quite drinkable and that is another plus, a nice earthy pumpkin ale with some nice pie spiciness.Nov 06, 2014"", ""650 mL bottle from the LCBO, bottled Aug 25 2014. Seeing this one locally was quite a shock, as it is probably the first bomber of BC beer I've ever bought in Sarnia. Served slightly chilled. Pours a translucent orange-amber colour, topped with one finger of dense, creamy off-white that recedes steadily over the next few minutes. A wispy film and thin collar are the only remnants. The aroma is subdued, but enticing nevertheless - grainy malts, brown sugar, nutmeg, cinnamon and clove come through nicely, with some gourdy pumpkin notes. The flavour is similarly subtle, but balanced beautifully and I've got to give it credit for that. More grainy sweetness and caramel provide much of the initial flavour, with pumpkin puree and pastry crust notes following up. The finish is where the spices shine, with a mixture of cinnamon and nutmeg complemented by lesser hints of clove and ginger - not overpowering, which I personally am thankful for. On the lighter side of medium-bodied, with a crisp mouthfeel attributable to the moderate levels of carbonation; a nice accent to the cinnamon and ginger. This is very drinkable for the style, with no particular aspect of the flavour overshadowing any other, and the alcohol remaining undetectable.Final Grade: 4.06, a superb A-. Steamworks Pumpkin Ale is a fine example of the style, easily avoiding the pitfall of becoming unnecessarily overspiced - my most common gripe with pumpkin beers. This is an approachable, no-nonsense example of the style that has been skilfully crafted in order to appeal to serious pumpkin ale fans, without scaring off people who bought it mostly because of the cool artwork on the label. Well worth a look if you spot it, and have any affectations for this style. This is my third Steamworks beer, and so far they are 3 for 3.Oct 31, 2014"", 'Pours a hazy orange with a foamy khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, earth, pumpkin, and pumpkin pie spice aromas. Taste is much the same with pumpkin, pie crust, and pumpkin pie spice flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a more earthy take on the pumpkin and pumpkin pie spice characteristics all around.Serving type: bottle.Oct 28, 2014', 'Said to be brewed with ""ghostly steam"", Steamworks Pumpkin Ale is indeed topped with a white sheet of head that basically provides the glass with a Halloween costume. Its orange colour, alight with a jack-o-lantern luminosity, contributes to the appearance\'s seasonal appropriateness. It\'s not a stretch to say that many Pumpkin Ales are reminiscent of pumpkin pie. That\'s typically the idea. But few taste and smell as vividly like it as Steamworks\'; this flavour is full of fresh-grated cinnamon stick, nutmeg, ginger root, and whole cloves (as opposed to the stale, dried and powdered kind). And the maltiness has a caramelized brown sugar-like sweetness to it.Somewhat miraculously, the notion of actual pumpkin is not entirely lost in this ocean of fresh spices and pie crust-like flavours. And it\'s for the better too; the pumpkin provides an earthy backdrop for all these sweet baking notes. Balancing such assertive and aromatic flavours is paramount to a good pumpkin ale - they deepen the flavour but shouldn\'t distract from drinkability. There\'s actually a number of important facets in crafting a tasty, drinkable Pumpkin Ale, two of the most significant of which are ensuring plenty of pumpkin pie-like spiciness without allowing them to get out of control, and moderating the alcohol since bold flavours combined with high alcohol will be out of balance and discombobulated. This example (6.5%) does both with absolute finesse. I often approach reviewing pumpkin ales with the enthusiasm of a man going to have a colonoscopy. Describing them is typically redundant and self-evident, and the notes are only of use to drinkers already predisposed to the style. But for what it\'s worth, I\'ve enjoyed Steamworks Pumpkin Ale to the very last drop and consider it among the best examples out there.Oct 27, 2014']",/beer/profile/3449/142904/

A loose collar of soapy froth lives on, framing the thin, bubbly film that still floats upon the surface; looks fine to me. The nose is fruity and tart as advertised, with notes of lemon, orange and grapefruit juice mingling politely with hints of passion fruit, pomegranate, mango, peach and pineapple. Hints of wheat malt sweetness, meanwhile, are scattered within the bouquet.Quite pleasant-tasting - the fruit (and hops) drive the profile along, while also seeming to keep the sourness in check. The aforementioned wheat malt sweetness is present, but serves mostly a structural role; it's easily pushed aside by flavours of passion fruit and pomegranate. I'm also getting suggestions of peach, mango, grapefruit and lemon; the latter is presumably an artifact of the lactic acidity, which remains a minor factor throughout the sip. Leans dry into the finish - I'm still getting a bit of tropical fruitiness in the aftertaste, but it fades swiftly, leaving the palate primed for subsequent sips. Light-medium in body, with moderate carbonation levels that delicately agitate the surfaces of the palate, as well as very high drinkability.Final Grade: 4.01, an A-. Steamworks' Tropical Tart Ale is a fine summer thirst-quencher that I'd more than likely recommend to other BAs - particularly those who have little experience in the realm of sour beer, but would still like to start dipping their feet in that pool. In all honesty, taken as a sour, I don't find this beer to be very compelling - it's really not very sour at all - but taken instead as a sessionable fruit beer, I feel that it's rather well-made. Steamworks products tend to come and go quietly from the LCBO, but this is one that I'll continue to purchase - at least, until it takes its seasonal leave from the shelves.Aug 21, 2018"", ""Another surprise out of the blue, this one from BC who is trying to work its way into Ontario (where I am.)

It finishes off-dry, the blended fruit esters kind of running the lingering table, as such.Overall - this is a pleasant enough version of the style, with the guest fruit adjuncts providing a bevy of flavour, so much so that it almost totally masks the base ale's sour character, which is fine by this sports fan.

The raspberries lend a fruit complexity to the aroma of this beer, and there is also a slight twinge of booze in the nostrils as well. Taste is fruity, but not overly so. The ale qualaties shine through as well with some lovely bready malts and dry hops adding more complexity to this brew. finish is dry and puckering with a bit of a boozy bite.

The head pours a thick, frothy and foamy and stays that way for a little while, settling down to a thin lacing over the liquid. There is also a thin lacing on the glass, presumably from the honey.S- This is the only area that I wasn't overly happy with, because the overall aroma is weak. While there are some honey notes, I smell more of a coffee aroma, and some grainy notes. However, none of the aromas are dominant and you really have to smell for them. The alcohol does come through somewhat in this brew.T- This was a surprising area for me as well. There is a fairly strong coffee flavor, along with some mild spice, which reminds me a little of cloves, as well as some powdered cocoa. In the backround, the honey notes are detectable, as there is a slight sweetness. There is also some hop zing on the finish, that lingers for a little while. This beer tastes more along the lines of a porter, but not as astringent.M- This doesn't have a real heavy body to it, so it is a decently refreshing beer. The carbonation is relatively fine....providing a bit of a zing on the palate, but not unwelcome. The honey provides a gentle smoothness, keeping the beer well balanced on the palate.D- I like this beer...it's different for sure, which is a good thing. I don't think I'd have more than one bottle of this in a sitting however, as the flavor is quite well defined and I think would work well with a meal better than on it's own.

I forgot I even had this bottle. A triple-gold-foiled 650ml bomber from the good folks at Tin Whistle, in one of my favorite places in Canada - Penticton, BC. In the interest of trying something different, and making room in my fridge, I started peeling off the foil...(there's a Slapshot reference in there somewhere).This beer appears a clear, deep dark brown colour, but with pervasive cola highlights when held up to the light, and one finger of weakly foamy, and mostly bubbly beige head, which disappears almost right away, even given the torrential pour, leaving a bit of streaky seaspray lace around the glass.It smells of almost burnt caramel malt, bittersweet baker's chocolate, creamed sweet clover honey, and a soft mushy nuttiness - seems promising. The taste delivers, straight away, a whole lot more of the milk chocolate and airy honey - this beer is not misnamed, with some subtle day-old coffee notes, and rather understated, but supportive earthy hops. The carbonation is active and pleasantly frothy, the body on the light side of medium weight, and mostly smooth, as a slight alcohol warming seems to seep in. It finishes off-dry, the honey sweetness kind of bleeding off, while the toasty malt digs in its heels. Not exactly a session beer (due to the heavy flavours, as opposed to the ABV), but still eminently enjoyable for its dessert-like qualities.

Pours out a deep, deep mahogany, still somewhat transluscent when held to the light, where it takes on a bit of a reddish cola hue. Smallish beige head that recedes quickly, not much retention.Deep toasted malt and chocolate malt, some wafer, and definitely a good dose of honey with sweetness and light grassy notes on the nose. Chocolate becomes more dominant as it warms, a rich boozy kind of chocolate.The flavour is quite rich and bolder than I anticipated. Some toasted malt up front, and then whammo, chocolate laced with the added sweetness of the honey presence, it reminds me of those booze-filled chocolates that come out around Xmas time. The finish is light and grassy and quickly overwhelmed by a cocoa-tinged aftertaste. Yup, this ale is all about the chocolate it seems. Yet it seems to work, it's not cloying in any way.The mouthfeel is on the light side, but that is more than compensated by the richness of the flavour, balancing it out and making it easily quaffable.I don't have much of a sweet tooth, and am not a huge fan of chocolate, but this ale still holds it together and manages to blow my skirt up somewhat all the same. Nowhere's near a session ale, at least not to my tastes, but I'll be getting more, and look forward to sharing it, especially as a dessert beer or a nightcap.Mar 22, 2007"", 'This rates a bit lower than it should because this is definitley not a pale ale.The only foil wrapped bottle from this brewery I\'ve seen.

The taste is gritty, grainy caramel malt, a bit of grapey vineyard fruitiness, strange sensations of watery cold cocoa beverages, and some leafy, citrusy, and floral hoppiness.The carbonation is fairly prevalent in its aggressive frothiness and laid-back fizziness, the body on the far light side of yer typical middleweight, and more or less smooth. It finishes off-dry, the caramel malt still looking sideways at that weird chocolate add-on that continues to follow it around like a lost puppy.A bit of a head-scratcher, this one is - the overall thin nature surely screams out session ale, but everything else leans almost towards a brown ale sort of thing.

Flavor is also English, much like the aroma with rich biscuit and caramel malt, dry grassy hops; long lingering biscuit and dry hop finish. Medium bodied with a pleasant light creaminess. Oddly both ales I had tonight are labeled in a way that I was expecting something else; first was a cream ale, now a ""West Coast Ale"", but both would not be out of place in an English pub. This is very malty with English style dry grassy hops. It is nicely balanced, pleasantly malty and nice to drink, but not what I\'d expect today for a West Coast style. On the other hand, this is likely to be what an English inspired ale might have been on the West Coast in the last century, and that\'s not a bad thing. Just south of British Columbia, we have quite a very small selection of good, malty English style ales. Truth is, I\'d buy this again in a heartbeat. I like malty ales and this is well balanced and flavorful. The only flaw is a bit of butteriness in the aroma, but that does not show up in the tasted.

Indeed, like the other brews I\'ve tried from Tree, this seems to lean more toward the malty, English style of the Pale Ale spectrum. There\'s some citrus and floral here, but it\'s really pretty restrained compared to the big malt character (the can says this is 36 IBU; I\'d have guessed closer to 20-25, tops).Colour is light, bright copper, with a decent, fairly persistent head of about a finger. Smell is the weakness--lightly grassy, with an almost musty, milk-y lactose kind of note lingering, with not much else. Taste is a back and forth between vegetal hops and sharp, toasty malt. Carbonation is a bit heavy. Tasty brew, but not earth-shattering.Jul 03, 2015', ""Perusing BA and the top beers in Canada, we in Ontario seem to be missing out on the greatness of BC and Quebec. Both well represented in the lists of top beers. Perhaps this is simply a case of the grass is greener on the other side.

So slightly different from the bottle shown here on BA.It pours clear and slightly orange with a good inch or so of head. The head subsides leaving generous lacing on the sides. Malty sweetness, caramel and pine resin assail the senses. I love that malty nose. This is a sweet beer with an underlying dry, hoppiness. Also tastes of pine and some steel. The finish alternates between the sweet malt and dry hops.

Head fades to a full wisp and leaves some foamy lacing down the glass. A splotchy wisp remains until the end and leaves some decent lacing the whole way. Head is a bit foamy, but this is alright. SMELL: Pale malts, caramel notes, honeydew melon and touches of grapefruit. Medium strength. TASTE: Light caramel and melon up front, then a medium but lingering finish of sweet bready malts and light caramel, floral flavors and some light grapefruit bitterness. Rather mundane. A nice caramel and sweet melon burst at the swallow is nice, but the rest of it is a bit boring and lacks the bitterness that was expected. PALATE: Medium body and medium carbonation. Creamy on the palate, goes down smooth and finishes a touch dry. Good feel. OVERALL: Okay. It’s labeled a “full flavored west coast ale,” but that really didn’t come to fruition.

Whether the flavour profile tickles your fancy or not, no one can say with a straight face that this isn't damned refreshing. Final Grade: 3.90, a B+. Tree's Cutthroat Pale Ale has a refined, understated quality about it that many APAs these days lack. There is nothing flashy about this one, but this blend of 10 different malts and hops comes together extremely well.

Its head is only moderate in size but makes an excellent decorator; the lacing its leaves behind is impressively ornamental and almost sticky enough to beat gravity (it loses the battle rather slowly, as the droopy patterns on the glass display). A blend of forest-y herbals, tree resin and candied fruit peels, this Pale Ale definitely smells like it's from the west coast. The amount of hoppiness in a beer's aroma doesn't necessarily indicate its bitterness, but this leads me to guess that this one lands somewhere in the thirties (answer: sure enough, 38 IBU). It's appreciably hoppy that's for sure.It is also, however, appreciably malty. The palate reveals where all that orange-y colour and dense haze comes from: a tall order of toasted grain. Flavours of toffee, toasted bread, and biscuits control much of the taste while the leafy and resiny notes stay more or less confined to the aroma and aftertaste (which itself has a fair bit of caramelized malt taste, mind you). In fact, there's enough caramelization and nuttiness that those 38 IBUs glide right over the tongue and into nothingness. This is considerably 'smooth' (by conventional standards) for an ale that retains a pronounced hoppiness. A beer like this needs balance and, indeed, this recipe has hit it with pin-point accuracy; the drinkability, so far as I'm concerned, is endless. I already knew that Tree made a solid IPA (Hop Head), an even better hop-bomb (Double Hop Head), and an excellent dark hop-bomb (Hop Head Black), but it's nice to know they also offer a more conservatively hopped pale ale too. While it may be better suited to the average commercial drinker, it's still an enjoyable, highly quaffable ale that meets the high standards of craft beer.May 01, 2014"", 'Poured from the can into a tulip pint glass.A real serious looker of a pale ale. Crystal clear body, and glowing perfect copper amber, with nice minimal rising pinhead carbonation. Head is large, aggressive, but in control and builds large with good solid pinhead sized bubbles throughout, four finger tall, large retention and thick island clumping. Spider and soapy lacing is all over. One fantastic looking pale ale.Nose is toasty, light grains and very dry. Some thrashing grains and ripped almost biscuit quality. Hop presence is not really large here or obvious, but with a large husky quality. If this is your thing, then things are going well.Real interesting palate. Light bodied pale ale sensing malt, and sharp yeast. Hop finish a bit with a steely grapefruit character and bordering on metallic twinge. Good notes of soft hinting caramel and light sweetness. Dry grainy toasty aromas manage to escape tremendously making sugars/caramel downplay.

Perhaps it\'s because out of the dozen ""sampling"" beers I bought, this was the only can. Oh those cans.The beer pours a very nice copper colour with a modest, two finger head. The head is very quick to dissipate. The beer has a very nice aroma, with citrusy hops making the beer have almost an orange-type smell. It has a bit of sweetness to it as well. The taste is something else. When the beer first hits my tongue, I\'m really unsure of what adjective to use to describe the taste. It is certainly quite hoppy with some fruity notes, but it tastes so much fuller, almost like a proper India Pale ale. I\'m actually quite stuck on what words to use, but rest assured if I knew what they were, they\'d be very positive.The finish is very strong for such a beer, and it leaves a strong hoppiness lingering on your tongue for a good twenty seconds. The carbonation level is appropriate, leaving the beer with a little tongue-tingling goodness and a smooth finish down the throat.Pretty good stuff.Sep 15, 2013', 'Serving glass: Poured from can into mug.Appearance: Copper colored with white head and light lacing.Smell: Toasted malts, citrus and some spiciness.Taste: Grainy, toasted malts with light citrusy hops and lots of spicy and floral notes.Feel: Moderate carbonation, medium body, dry finish.Overall: Very straightforward APA, which is solid but little stands out.Jun 11, 2013', 'Can strangely bought in Halifax last week with a date (which I assume to be ""best before"") of 19/11/12.

A very mild aroma of caramelized malts, even after it warms. Taste is a bit more complex, but also utterly ""inoffensive"" - caramelized malted barley sweetness transitioning into a dry hopped finish that doesn\'t linger long and maintains a sweet backbone.Probably an excellent gateway or transition beer for someone just moving away from macro lagers.Sep 08, 2012', ""I got a pair of 500 mL cans. It pours with big, white/slightly-yellow, creamy head. The body is clear with an orange-amber colour.I love the aroma. It smells fresh with hints of fresh fruits like apricot/peach and citrus. The aroma carries through into the taste. Starting with a more citrus fruitiness, I get a dark chocolate taste (there could be some vanilla in there?) and a fantastic floral hops finish. It has a medium-to-full body and heavy carbonation.Overall, I love smell and taste of this beer. I haven't particularly cared much for west coast hops, they work great here. The only downside is the feel which has too much carbonation and is a tiny bit thin.Apr 19, 2012"", ""Orange colour. Decent head of the pour and well-marked lacings. Restrained hop aromas.

Buttery, bready malt, caramel, sweetness, light grassy hops. Like GIB's English Bay Pale Ale on steroids. T - Heavier on the hops than expected, without as much malty characteristic as the aroma hinted at. The hops are done pretty well here though, with a refreshing and clean feel to them. Balanced pretty well between the malty backbone and the hops upfront. M - A little thicker and drier on the finish than anticipated. Fitting mouthfeel for the ale.D - Overall, a solid APA.

Finish is slightly bitter, but pleasurable, with some caramel malts lingering on the tongue.M - Great mouthfeel with perfect carbonation and finishes only slightly dry. Goes down smooth and quick!D - A decent pale ale offering and another winner from Tree. I'm always a fan of pale ale which has moderate hop presence, making it easily sessionable, not overly bitter, and poundable.

Looks to have a decent amount of carbonation, and there are big bubbles clinging to the side of the glass inside the liquid. Nice sticky lacing forms around the glass, and actually looks like a snow capped mountain. S- This is a well balanced smelling brew, initially having aromas of sweet malts (they use 5 different varieties). There is also a noticeable floral aroma and some citrus zest. On the back end, there is fresh leafy hop smells, giving this a pleasant bitterness to take in.T- Again, this has a decent balance between sweet and bitter. The initial malts hit the palate hard, but quickly are neutralized by the fresh herbal hop cones on the finish. In between there is some crisp floral and citrus notes and I even detect a slight tart apple flavor....very interesting.M- Medium bodied and creamy smooth! The carbonation is much smaller than it looked, providing a relatively buttery experience on the palate. I really get a good sense of the hop bitterness because of the smoothness in the beer.D- I could really get into this ale! It's clean, yet flavorful and smooth at the same time.

The head disappears after a minute or two. Smells of yeast, light citrus, spring water, sweet pale malt, floral hops. Alright but nothing special. This is a decently flavourful pale ale, presenting a blend of floral and earthy hops. Under the hops lies a good base of light caramel and some minerals. Somehow, it\'s not tied together in the best way. I can\'t put my finger on what it is, but there\'s something here that isn\'t totally working. Maybe the interesting bits were filtered out. Not too shabby though. The hops leave a bitter finish, along with a touch of alcohol. The feel is okay: medium-light body and moderate carbonation.The can states this one is ""a classic pale ale""; classic as in on the plain side of things, I suppose. I\'d say it\'s your standard pale ale with a better hop presence than usual. This doesn\'t really rank among the better Canadian pale ales I\'ve had, but it\'s not bad.

A stalwart on the Canadian pale ale scene, or at least that's been my experience, with this one.This beer pours a clear, bright pale amber hue, with two fingers of puffy, and lightly foamy off-white head, which leaves a stellar complex of webbed lacing around the glass as it genially recedes.It smells of grainy caramel malt, an underlying sweet bready biscuit character, pleasantly muddled orchard fruit, and floral, citrus hops. The taste is mildly sweet caramel-tinged biscuity malt, one aligned quite nicely with the orange and grapefruit citrus and flower pod hop notes. It does seem to lend itself towards IPA introspection, this much is certain.The carbonation is very much on the low side, just a pique of frothiness here and there, the body a sturdy medium weight, and quite equitably smooth. It finishes clean, dry, and agreeably hoppy. A very easy beer to drink, although the overall intensity of hoppy goodness is well moderated, which I suppose is to be expected, as this can butt up against its big brother Hop Head only so much.

Some spicy and citrus hop undertones and caramel malt elements add depth.Flavour starts out with a slightly sweet malt profile which is cut across by a slash of citrus hops. After the fizz dies, the piney hops move in escorted by a faint sweet undertone to a moderately bitter finish. Aftertaste is bitter hops (both piney and citrus).Medium bodied and moderately carbonated. The carbonation and hop bite make this crisp, but there is an oily feeling left in the mouth that makes this beer not so clean.This is a good representation of an American Pale Ale. Most APAs I've tried seem to be a little out of balance towards the hop side and Cutthroat is no different.

The nose is a really fine balance of sweet and creamy malt with spicy but far from overpowering hops in closer. Definite vanilla beans in the aroma, honey, some dry paper-like notes, pasta, flower pollin, light malt, and grass. The aroma is dominated by a soft creaminess, followed by sourish wet grass, and then the hops and malt. Definitely a unique aroma for a BC pale ale. The taste is malty with enough dryness. Vanilla and the malt at first, with a very bittering bite through the middle and finish. An offish taste of strong alcohol or cardboard makes me think the storing of them was less than ideal. (I think they may have got a little warm in my van driving from BC.)The taste is still delicious and well-balanced. The beer has a thick body, velvety and a little oily.

Green label, watercoloured landscape with a cartoony looking trout leaping above the beer's name. Although Big Rock's label was teal, and the trout more rendered.Pours out an average looking clear light amber, a one-finger spongy head that settles down after about a minute, yet still retains a thin cap the rest of the way. By the smell of it this this beginning to flesh out more as a Chinook clone. Light toffee malt rounded out by floral and herbal hops, a hint of citrus. The flavour tastes of a blend of Chinook and Cascade hops. The malt plays a very back seat role in this pale ale, the hops dominate, yet don't overpower. The mouthfeel starts out smooth, but the carbonation kicks in on the finish, which in collaboration with the hops makes this more of a quenching pale ale, along the lines of a good Czech pilsener. Still, overall this strikes me as an average pale ale, the only thing mildly different being the hop profile. And even though I won't go pointing fingers about who's doing what in the craft beer industry, I have to admit that I prefer Tree's Cutthroat to the obsolete version of what I've been comparing it to, for the sole fact that it possesses more character, isn't as rounded out around the edges and dumbed down. This is a west coast pale ale for those who enjoy hops other than cascade.Apr 03, 2005""]",/beer/profile/2594/22951/

Nicely informative note about the origin of the term 'radler' on the label.This, um, cough, beer pours a cloudy, very pale yellow-tinged straw colour, with two pudgy fingers of puffy, rather loosely foamy, and generally fizzy off-white head, which leaves very little in the way of persistent lace anywhere near the glass as it steadily abates.It smells of dry, pithy grapefruit flesh and/or juice, the unsweetened kind, more rind than any sort of potentially sugary sort of thing, and a pale wheaty maltiness that is more ethereal than actually discernible and parsable. The taste is more grapefruit, of the sugary persuasion, but yet one still sassy and unyielding in its inherent tartness, over a weakened and somehow persistent wheaty base malt, simplicity being the marker here.The bubbles are a bit intense up front, but settle quickly to a pleasant, and plainly understated frothiness, the body the story du jour, in its heady, almost full-seeming medium weight, with a less-than engaging smoothness, the veritable grapefruit bitterness the villain here. It finishes pretty much dry, the fruitiness of the obvious non-participating sort, as far as promoting the lingering, cut off at the knees maltiness is concerned.Bandwagon aspiration accusations aside (ok, not), this tastes exactly like what it purports to be, unlike the target of its raison d'etre, around here, Stiegl Radler.

In my younger days I'd probably be a bit more generous, but this is a pretty generic smelling hefe. Nothing bad about it though.Taste: I sorta hate to say it, but this is a fairly typical average hefe. There's nothing bad about it, but nothing stands out. It starts with a bit of wheat malt then turns to banana phenol and ends with clove notes.

Additional varieties always seem to migrate to the shelves around this time of year, and as a ticker I just can't resist the temptation to try every single one I can get my clammy little hands on.Pours a murky yellowish colour with a twinge of amber, topped with nearly two fingers of silky, creamy white head with excellent retention. It takes well over five minutes for the foam to die down to a thin cap, and it leaves plenty of lacing smudged all over the sides of the glass. The aroma contains most of the usual hefe tropes - sweet wheaty malts, banana, yeast and some clove spiciness. Decent, but far from unique.Unfortunately, that last sentence seems to be just as appropriate when applied to the flavour. It starts off comparable to most hefes - firm backbone of sweet, bready wheat malts, supported by subdued notes of lemon, banana and clove. The finish is where it differs substantially - this particular offering is quite dry, with a pronounced grassy bitterness that lingers on the palate. The aftertaste is what really turns me off here - it's a bit chalky, a bit minerally, and just mildly off-putting in general. Relatively light-bodied and watery, without any slickness and very little chew. Good carbonation for the style - enough to keep it reasonably crisp and refreshing. Not the most inspiring hefe I've had recently, but I suppose it's serviceable enough. The chalky aftertaste combined with the relatively weak malt profile has left me a bit underwhelmed - and I have always considered myself relatively easy to please when it comes to this style. Maybe I've just been spoiled by all the great German hefes that are so easy to find around here.Final Grade: 3.28, a slightly mediocre C+. I'd hesitate to call Tree's Hefeweizen bad, but I'd be just as hesitant to call it good, too. To be blunt (and I must hand over control to my 'inner hipster' to actually type this without wincing), it's kinda sorta 'meh'. The bomber is definitely not worth the 6 dollar price tag, especially when there is a bottle of the vastly superior Weihenstephaner next to it selling for half as much. I'd be willing to retry this somewhere in B.C. where freshness is less likely to be an issue, but it's not something I intend to revisit anytime soon. This one could use some work, but the basic foundations of a decent hefe are mostly present, so there's no reason it wouldn't quench your thirst on a hot night like this.Jul 12, 2012"", 'Bottle into weizen glass.Date on bottle is 06/10/12 (hoping it means Oct 6th)A- Hazy as hell (duh) cascading sunrise of color.

Minerally finish makes it a tad too thin for my taste. Like quite a few of the Canadian hefes that have come out lately (and there have been many), this is high on the refreshing wheat malt and low on the spice.

The beer is still sunny, however, despite all the foggy overtones. The surface of the glass is so padded with white foam that it could probably absorb a Major League fastball. The bouquet is spicy and fragrant - it's like someone just added a dash of clove while I wasn't looking. The beer may be German-inspired - as its name suggests - but the remarkable semblance to clove in this aroma has me thinking Jamaican jerk, Indian lentils or Autumn squash soup. Or it would, if not for scents of cereal grain and sweet malt. The primary flavors of dry grass, hay, and cereal grain are enlivened by notable banana fruit notes and a sprinkling of clove spice. High-revved carbonation does a fine job of impressing those tastes right into the palate. The beer feels very creamy in the mouth but a rash of minerals and sharp bubbles spring up on the finish.The beer marries sweetness and spice, but both in fairly modest quantities. As far as the strong bubblegum-y banana and clove spice qualities typical of the style, this recipe goes in only knee-deep. Despite the flavor profile starting strong, it ultimately lacks in texture and can, on some sips, drink more like a pale ale or lager. Tree Hefeweizen has enough character to emulate a bona fide German offering, albeit one of the more commercial brands. What I mean is that it has the flavors and quality requisite of the style, but also an easy approachability and potential for mass appeal.

I would definitely get this again.Apr 03, 2009"", ""See as this beer has been retired, I'm gonna guess mine was an older sample because it seemed fizzy with no real head retention or lacing. It certainly smelled Hefe-like with very faint banana, some stronger clove, and some very up front wheatiness. Tasted very much like a good bavarian Hefe, but with a more pronounced malt profile. I found, like others, that it got nicely spicey towards the end. The over-all body was good, but I did find it a bit astringent in the final mouthfeel dept. Certainly drinkable, but something seemed off to me, let's hope it was a beer past it's best-before-date and would love to try a fresher sample.Oct 09, 2007"", ""Grabbed one of these as they are slowly disappearing from most stores.Pours a bright hazy yellow, maybe a faint green. Poor head and lacing. Expected more.Not a lot of smell on this one. Maybe a hint of bananas, but it's light.Sourness upfront with some bubblegum. Refreshing Golden Delicious apples in the middle, very clean and light with a wheaty, slightly sweet finish.Light body and quite astringent. This is a sour and fruity hefe. Quite crisp and refreshing. It's not bad, but it leaves much to be desired. Reminds me of celery. Would consider again if the price is right (averages 6 bucks for a bomber).Sep 26, 2007"", 'A nice addition to the influx of wheat beers in BC. This one pours big and cloudy with a strong nose of wheat, bubblegum and citrus. Very well constructed and not overly banana in its finish, this is a deep enough Hefe to travel into early fall. Please put it in six packs for next summer.Sep 22, 2006', 'Bottle: Poured a cloudy deep yellow color beer with an average bubbly head with limited retention. Aroma of wheat is dominant with some subtle bananas. Taste is dominated by rich wheat with a full body and limited filtration.

The yeast sediment provides plenty of citrus-rind & earthyness.M: Smooth moderate body and carbonation.D: Well-rounded, mild flavours; good introduction to the style; great drinkability.Sep 12, 2006', 'Cloudy orange and gold in colour with medium carbonation. Potent aromas of banana, clove, and gum-drops. Good wheaty thickness on the palate. Some fairly assertive yeast flavors to this one, not to mention grainy. The lemony-banana fruit flavors are more reserved. There are some grassy hop notes on the back end as well, with a slightly drying finish. This one is very close to being excellent. The aroma, the body, and the potency of the flavors are there, but it\x92s just a bit too yeasty and dry. At least it\x92s not sweet or watery like some other attempts at this style. Many thanks to Presario for the tasty extra.Sep 11, 2006', 'I tend to rate all my beers on the other beer website but someone pointed to support Canadian Micro breweries I should rate on both sites so here it goes.

Meatier as a Schneider and fucking drinkableSep 04, 2006', ""This is the best domestic Hefe I've had, and even though it isn't quite in the same league as a classic like Paulaner, it's certainly worthy of a recommendation to anyone who comes across it.It poured from a 650 mL bomber with a fluffy two-finger head topping a cloudy straw-coloured body with some copper highlights. The smell seemed underwhelming \x97 a little banana, but not much more.The taste starts with banana, bubblegum and some general fruitiness that yields to a lemony puckering in the middle. It finished spicy \x97 a little too much so, in my mind, for this style. The mouthfeel and carbonation make for a smooth brew that is, for the most part, a refreshing experience.Aug 22, 2006"", 'I love to see domestic craft brewers trying their hand at the oft-unmatched style of a true German hefeweizen. Tree has always done well with all their styles though, and this hefe by Tree should be interesting. This is new to Alberta.A 650ml bottle here: simple yellow and white label with the word ""hefeweizen"" across it. The beer pours a thick unfiltered orange colour, with yellows and tangerine colours. The head is solid, thick and bright white in colour. Good retention and good lacing. So far so good. The beer is impermeable, but certainly doesn\'t have any ""floaties"" of yeast in it, like some other domestic hefes I have tried. The aroma is plagued by over-ripe banana, like so many attempted hefeweizens, but it\'s pleasant enough. To its credit it has some bark-like spiciness which I have found in some Germans. Cream and butter, some clove and a distinct bitterness. Not overly complex, but better than most other domestic varieties, I think by far. Taste is spicy, full of banana and ends with pronounced bitterness--very good hopping indeed. It starts light and very creamy on the tongue, with some metallic tang and numbing clove. By the middle the taste is full on banana and other fruits, as well as some spice. The finish is actually a little TOO bitter for a hefeweizen. All in all though, this is mighty tasty. Low in carbonation, with a full mouthfeel. Extremely drinkable. This is the best Canadian hefe I have had, and, rating in view of style for that demographic, this rates high on my list. Recommended.Aug 15, 2006', 'Appearance \x96 Pours a golden color resembling honey slightly. It\x92s cloudy and has a small amount of white head. Smell \x96 Banana is there along with sweet nectar and cloves. I smell citrus hops and grains as well. Overall quite nice here. Taste \x96 Not as strong as the smell suggested. It\x92s somewhat malty and quite full of banana flavor. I also detect grapefruit and lemon with some adjuncts. Not bad. Mouthfeel \x96 This one has a decent body to it...not too heavy not to light. The carbonation is a little sharp on the tongue though.Drinkability \x96 Pretty good. I didn\x92t have any trouble here downing this one.This has the characteristics of a good Hefeweizen. Some fine tuning would improve it though.Jul 28, 2006', ""Pours a hazy yellow-arange with a finger of creamy head. The head isn't as big as I expect from a hefe, but it seems to have some staying power. Lacing is left all over my weizen glass.The smell is loaded towards the bubblegum and cloves. Banana is in there, but more sugary than natural. The strength of the clove aroma almost gives it the impression of smokiness.Cloves again take the lead in the taste department. Sweeter flavours seem muted in this one. Tart is the overall impression. Doesn't seem to have much variety to the flavour.For a hefe this one is full bodied, it has a creamy feel. Carbonation is subtle, not overdone.This doesn't go down quite as well as some of the best hefe's I've had, but it is still a good beer on a hot evening.Jul 23, 2006"", ""Can't believe I beat the B.C. boys in adding this one. Picked up a bottle of it at Willow Park. Hard to miss this one, the bright yellow label stands out amongst the riff-raff.Came in a 650 ml brown bottle. Pours out a very cloudy/hazed solid apricot hue, very dense in appearance. A large white merruengue-like spongy head caps it off, and retains well.Aroma is straight wheat grain, candied bananas and nutmeg, no other perks or quirks, simply true to style.This is a very malty hefe, a solid wall of wheat malt up front, which becomes the predominant flavour in this ale. Mostly rounded, just a touch of tartness that brewing with wheat can sometimes provide. The true flavour profile doesn't present itself until the full bottle is eventually poured out into the glass. The wall of malt fades back a touch, yet the wheat does become more sharp and tart. In fact it finishes with that wheat tartness, perhaps assisted with some sort of hop bill as well. Not much spice in the flavour, just a hint of nutmeg towards the finish. The mouthfeel is full and thick, perhaps a bit too thick at times for a summer quaffer, but I'm not really complaining about that, it's always nice to come across a beer with a solid body.In the end it's a fairly one-dimensional take on a hefe to me, however all of the components of the style are in there. A good stepping stone ale and introduction to the style for the uninitiated.Jul 22, 2006""]",/beer/profile/2594/31826/

Hints of caramel and musty vanilla bean. Palate is similarly mellow, flavorsome but far from robust. Corn flakes, white bread, grass, hay, faint licorice and flower bulb, radish, tarragon. A grain husk astringency comes on late. I want to say I'm getting a marmalade or lemon fruitiness but this is ephemeral.Thin bodied and highly carbonated although the latter is not overdone. Finishes clean and with a classy smooth bitterness. A slight whiff of sulfur perhaps, and a root cellar mustiness. Drinkable, not cloyingly sweet. Decent noble hopping.

This is a totally serviceable pale lager.Mouthfeel: light body but with tons of carbonation which keeps things interesting enough.Overall: like I said, totally serviceable.

Not a very encouraging aroma.T - Barley and corn, slight hoppiness, and a touch of honey upfront. Finishes with a metallic twang that I don't really love. Lacking in the hops for sure.

Hop flavour barely perceptible, but the bitterness builds on the tongue. Also slightly butterscotch.Mouthfeel.

Maybe there's not enough body to balance the flavours. I think they should have gone for a little more flavour complexity. It would be nice to taste a bit of hops too. I think some of the aroma and the butterscotch indicate diacetyl.May 26, 2012"", ""Bought a pair of 500 mL cans. It pours with a little creamy white head. The body looks like golden apple juice. The aroma is heavy with grains with a little honey and orange. If I could describe the smell in one word, it would be 'harvest'. The taste is more like cider. It as a sharp malt and dull hops.

Plenty of bready malt on the nose, but I'm missing the grassiness I'm looking for. True to the aroma, grainy malt is the dominant flavour. Hops are disapointingly absent. Longing for some fresh zing from continental hops and a good grass seed aroma to really put an exclamation mark on the fine malt. Mouthfeel helps with the overall refreshing character of the beer. Nice crisp carbonation. Nice enough, needs a good hit of hops.Jan 13, 2012"", ""Kelowna Pilsner shows faint signs of carbonation but its almost brassy colour suggests plenty of malt. The beer looks like it was made from gold leaf. I'm not sure whether to drink it or to trade it in at the jewelers for cash. Although bubbles are visible, no head ever materializes (except off the pour, but that quickly faded). It smells like I've just untwisted the knot off a loaf of white bread. It's such a soft-smelling breadiness - like Wonderbread's cousin that doesn't have all the additives and preservatives. Indeed the malt has a wonderful effervescence that is rarely, if ever, present in pasteurized pilsners. I want to make a sandwich now. If it weren't for the very mild hop flavour that comes with belching, this beer could almost transport me back to my childhood - it tastes just like soft, spongy, bleached white Wonderbread. There's even just enough water minerals to impress a slightly salty quality. That may sound an undesirable thing to most, and I hate to think how insulting it must sound to the brewmaster, but all I mean to convey is that Kelowna Pilsner has a fantastically bready malt character. It is every bit as flavourful, clean, and wholesome as any bona fide German pilsner. In fact, I find it superior to many of them.Kelowna Pilsner is a gratifying pale lager if ever I had one. Beers so clean and simple yet flavourful are surprisingly rare, and even less often are they as good as advertised.

Nothing else, nothing more.Mouthfeel: Pretty heavy carbonation. Very smooth swallow. Goes down well and sits well. Very refreshing.Drinkability: Good. For the price this pilsner is way above 90% of the other offerings available in BC Liquor Stores.Nov 15, 2009', '5ml can.This beer pours a hazy, light golden yellow colour, with one finger of silky, puffy, eggshell white head, which leaves a low ring of breaking surf lace around the glass as it quickly settles. It smells fairly strongly of white cracker grain, sourdough, a bit of aged lemon, and grassy hops. The taste is biscuity white grain, edgy lemon citrus, and punchy grassy, leafy hops. The carbonation is moderate and affable, the body medium weight, and smooth, but with some fruity pith-like infusion. It finishes dry, some lemon and floral notes lingering.This is indeed much more reminiscent of a good Euro-pilsener, than the listed pale lager. Easy to put back, especially if were a hot, sunny day.

Earthy hop/malt blend, slightest touch of metallic. Light body and mouthfeel, easy to drink, but nothing that really stands out.

Lager-y flavour of decent barley malt, but the peppery fizz does put a limit on the flavour profile of this one.Mouthfeel - very active, helps with the refreshment, but gets in the way of the flavour as mentioned.Drinkability - this is a good beer to have a few of.

The crispness looses itself as I work my way through the glass.Tree brewery has some great beers, but this would be my least favourite.

T: Comes across as a bit too malty. A little earthy, and an herbal hoppiness that is a little unbalanced against the malt presence.M: Body is lighter, as it should be, but there is still a bit of a stickiness that is a little out of place. D: Easy on the alcohol, as it should be. Probably not a choice I'd make, but a reasonable brew for the sake of drinking it without expecting much.Jul 01, 2008"", ""This style is available only in 8 packs, like their release of Rebel lager.Pours out a slightly hazed bright gold, immense amount of carbonation, which helps form the powder snow white short head, and maintains its impressive retention.The aroma is predominantly floral and herbal hops, with a break of bready malt from time to time.Hmmmm, the hops and the malt don't seem to play very nicely together in the flavour however. Grassy, herbal hops from the very beginning, allowing a sweet liquid--sometimes biscuity--malt to start poking through near the middle already. They're both there in the flavour profile but aren't working together, balancing or complementing one another, just simply present as seperate entities. Yet through all of this lack of synchronicity everything evens out and balances within the aftertaste, leaving me with an impression that I enjoyed this pilsener more than I actually did.Mild sandpaper texture in the mouthfeel from the carbonation, but it compliments the style and gives it a bit of oomph.Even though there's some discord within the flavour I still don't mind this pilsener for an easy-drinking session beer from time to time, it quenches my hop fix at least. However not the first pilsener I would point to when asked what to sample from the style.Jan 20, 2008"", 'Tree seems to want to rebadge their lagers since I think was the same beer as the fireweed pils. All in all this is an OK pils that finishes slightly sweet and has some hops in the nose. Drinkable and fairly forgetable at the same time. Buy it as part of their cool 8 variety pack so you get the great ales as well.Oct 05, 2007', ""A clear, pale yellow-orange colour, with a thin white cap. Lots of visible carbontion rises to the head.Sweet grain is dominant in the aroma. Almost a sweetened lemonade smell. Can't say that hops are notable.Slightly sweet and grainy, cracker like malts. Crisp, with very little hop finish, something a little medicinal is all I can attribute to the hops. Still some of that sweet lemonade impresson. Doesn't impress really.Light to medium body, with ample carbonation, it does pretty well for a lighter lager.I get the feeling that this is Tree's stab at turning some of the macro drinkers on to their beers.

When poured into a glass very little head. Nice mild taste. Very little bitter taste and not much on the fruits. This beer is very much to my liking.Sep 19, 2015', ""330 mL bottle from a six-pack picked up at a London TBS; best before Oct. 21 2014. This is the last bottle (served slightly chilled), as I let a friend drink the remainder of this sixer a few days ago. Pours a clear copper-amber colour, topped with one finger of frothy, relatively short-lived off-white head. It soon dissipates, leaving behind a soapy film, narrow collar and a ring of lace. The aroma is definitely on the saccharine side, with bready malts, caramelized sugar and ripe plum being the dominant facets. A little grassy, but the malt bill steals the show here for sure.The flavour is of toasted grains, caramel, and doughy bread initially, with some vaguely nutty notes to complement. Mildly grassy toward the finish, with an earthy feel to the hop bitterness that completes the profile. Malt sweetness carries into the aftertaste. On the lighter side of medium-bodied, with restrained carbonation and a surprisingly smooth, satisfying feel on the palate. This is a well-balanced amber that would be easy to drink in large quantities.Final Grade: 3.65, a B grade. Tree's Thirsty Beaver Amber Ale isn't quite a stand-out, but it's still a respectable malt-forward session amber in its own right. This is not complex or extreme enough to turn off the craft beer uninitiated, but remains a balanced, well-brewed beer that is easy to appreciate. A worthy effort, and a quality amber that I'll probably return to again at some point.Jun 22, 2014"", ""Poured from 500mL can into a pint glass.Appearance: deep, rich amber hue with no haze and a pretty strong effervescence. Head is a finger of pillowy tan foam with OK retention. I really like the color.Smell: toasty and caramelly with a light hop element. Pretty low-key, but well-enough composed for an amber.Taste: more caramelly than toasty; the element of biscuit is minimal which I like. A bit on the sweet side, but again that's a plus for me for amber ales. Not particularly hoppy, but I like this beer anyway -- it gives me caramel and without too much astringent biscuit.Mouthfeel: medium-light body with a very well-integrated carbonation and a nice creaminess. Good stuff.Overall: I'm not always a fan of this style, but this beer suits my palate pretty well.May 21, 2014"", ""Enjoyed a bottle at one of the many Hudson's locations in Calgary. Poured into a pint glass. This brew is darkish cola brown with a reddish tint, including a decent quantity of light tan foam. The aroma needed some additional time to warm up before revealing its true capabilities and wasn't too bad at this point. Smells quite fruity, I get some red apple and fermented plum, along with the expected brown sugar and less expected faint molasses. The aroma is a nice balance of dark malt and fruit. Little in the way of hops on the nose. Quite a fizzy beer with a semi-chewy, almost buttery mouth feel. Tastes of brown bread, the aforementioned fruit, honey, caramel, faint molasses, brown spice, and black tea-like earthy hops, the latter figuring more prominently on the palate than the nose. Does not taste of west coast citrus or pine. Finish is semi-dry, with some nutty bitterness and a little booze that recalls rum extract. All in all, a tasty amber ale in a style space that can be awash with mediocrity.Jan 12, 2014"", 'Poured from the can into my sam adams glass that I recently acquired from my store. This is a pretty popular offering from Tree Brewing in my locale.The beer is a brown colour with a tinge of red to it. The head is beige and stands about 3 cm.

Seems pretty standard for an amber ale.Very full bodied taste - not shy on the hops either, which is nice to see in such a beer. Still, the beer is noticeably malty, yet is not sweet. Really nice balance. Touch of booziness in the aftertaste.Fine beer; standard stuff, but well done.Sep 16, 2013', ""This is the official line: my review follows.Dave Goekiert has travelled to Caledonian Brewery, in Edinburgh, to collaborate in re-creating this beer especially for this Wetherspoon real-ale festival. We consider this very apt, as beavers have recently been reintroduced to Scotland. This amber-coloured beer has a slightly sweet malt aroma, leading to a distinct malt character, with caramel and nut undertones in the flavour, resulting in a beer with a clean finish and bursting with flavour. Hops used: Cascade, Palisade, Perle.Hand-pulled pint on 1st Nov 2012 in Montgomery's Tower, a Wetherspoons pub in Shrewsbury.Amber body, clean and clear, a creamy head in colour and texture sat on top, staying for most of the tasting, UK pint sleeves are good at picking up lacing and this brew left some heavy lacing as the beer level fell.The nose and taste were of malty molasses: caramel and some toffee esters too.Earthy, woody feel to the body, although fairly sweetand malty initially, it calms down nicely and ends with a semi-bitter, dry aftertaste. Not bad at all, and at £1.49 a pint (with my 50p voucher), a real bargain.Nov 02, 2012"", 'Can driven from Halifax last week, with no indication of brewing or canning date. It tastes fresh, but may have faded. Pours a bright but dusty, dark amber with white head and impressive lacing. Has a muted aroma of roasted malts. I would have classified this as a simple amber rather than an ""American"" version, only because there is absolutely no indication of west coast hops, anywhere. Caramelized malt sweetness leads into an inoffensively dry finish. The lingering notes are very mild, neither sweet nor bitter. Much nicer than any macro amber and probably an excellent transition beer for anyone just starting to experiment with flavour.Sep 15, 2012', 'Pours a hazy, rusty amber colour with a small white head that gets retained as a collar without leaving much lace behind.Sweet, syrupy and malty aroma with a strong caramel tone and pronounced vegetal character. Also has hints of chocolate, allspice and wet grass.The taste has a deep, roasted malt flavour with a nice fruit tone behind it. Solid bitterness balanced by a syrupy sweetness. Vegetal character returns in the finish, along with a peppery note Medium-bodied with low carbonation. Yeast and bread-like character on the tongue. Aftertaste is somewhat bitter with a lingering roasted malt flavour and a hint of diacetyl.Decent amber ale, but something about the vegetal quality puts me off a bit and it’s a bit too much sweet caramel for my taste overall. Has paired best in my experience with sandwiches and salty snacks.Sep 04, 2012', ""Appearance: 500ml can, poured into glass. Red/brown. At least 2 finger head.

(HOW?!) Not a great start. After grabbing a FULL bottle of this ale, it pours a clean copper hue with a light tan head of frothy foam.S - Smells of sweet caramel malt with notes of toffee as well. Nice grassy hop presence. A bit of buttery biscuits and bread too. Quite nice.T - Wow, talk about a let down. Starts off with the malty presence as expected, but immediately heads south, with a big adjunct grain flavor. Finish is cereal and corn, with a dash of grassy hops. The malt flavor never comes to fruition either. While this amber ale may not be generously hopped, I would have been happy with a nice malty ale as well, but this really isn't either. Disappointing. M - Carbonation is a bit fizzy, and the body is quite light and watery. This doesn't do anything to help the already adjunct lager-esque flavor profile. D - Overall, this amber ale was thoroughly disappointing. Just not enough flavor to be anything more than mediocre. This ale was no where near up to par with the Tree brews I've had in the past; I'll pass next time.Jan 26, 2012"", 'Pours dark red. Thin head settles quickly. Not much in the way of lacings. Earthy aromas. Slightly sweet malt with just enough hops to bring it back down.Malt backbone is pretty standard for a North American Red. Slightly sweet, with the hopping adding a bit more earthy depth. Mouthfeel is a bit disappointing. Too much carbonation takes away from whatever more interesting flavours are there. This one is sort of in the Canadian Ale category, charting a course between the fruit & nut English offerings and hopped up American versions. It works well enough.Jan 13, 2012', ""Pour - dark amber with a great looking inch of head. Carbonation looks spot on and the appearance is clean and clear. This looks lovely and won't last long - I can already tell.Aroma - biscuity malt, bread dough, caramel, brown sugar, burnt sugar, ice cream cones.Taste - sweet and malty with a bit of toastiness, almost reminds me of a brown ale as its got a lot of character. So smooth and clean and quite thirst quenching at a very reasonable 5%. Love the malt profile of this beer, its sweet but not too sweet and brings about so much flavor. When beers taste like this I'm okay that there isn't a whole lot of hop presence. Great beer. Wish I had more.Overall - it's no wonder this is their most popular beer. It's smooth, easy to drink and very tasty. Amber Ales tend to be the go to brew for many a beer drinker that has yet to really test their palate with something uber-hopped, barrel-aged or strong enough to be served in a snifter. Regardless of where you are with your beer drinking this is a beer you won't be sorry you tried. You may even try a few more...just to make sure. As amber ales go, this is better than most.Sep 06, 2011"", ""Thirsty Beaver is a fairly bright caramel brown tone that retains transparency even after the addition of some bottom-dwelling yeast. While streams of carbonation are visible, something clogs the bubbles up as no head forms; the beer could have used the foam to cover up the muddied, less-than-aesthetic colour that reflects off its bare surface. Although flat at first, the aroma grew quite musty with warmth, developing a strong cellar character like that of a bière de garde. This impression is helped along by some impressively rich, sweet malt that has very perceivable notes of toffee, dried cherry, grapes and an earthy component compounded by the vague presence of spicy Noble hops. Thirsty Beaver is my kind of amber ale: it is rich with malt and the hops were added later in the boil so that their flavour is appreciated, but not much of their bitterness. The lack of kettle hops preserves flavours of toffee and dried fruits and contributes a blend of peppery, steely and fruity notes without any lingering pungency or harsh weedy elements.All that said, an extra handful of hop pellets wouldn't have thrown anything off; malt outnumbers hops by a considerable ratio. I also might dull the bubbles just a touch; not only does their fizziness detract from the flavour but, like an over-eager waiter, ushers it all away too quickly. I keep saying: 'Hey! I wasn't done with that!' I would have liked some aftertaste. Thirsty Beaver should be taken more seriously than the cartoon beaver on its label might have you to believe; while it initially struck me as a commonplace, average amber ale - which by most accounts it is - I found some very interesting, albeit subtle, bière de garde-like characteristics that made this far more memorable than most in the style otherwise are.Aug 14, 2011"", ""This beer has a nice reddish amber colour (whoda thought?), and a thin layer of foamy head settles on top.Some toasty malts come through in the nose alongside some sweetness.The taste is quite good.

Sweet bread. Sweet like an oktoberfestbier. Come to think of it, it does taste like a clean oktoberfest. Sweet bready flavors all around the palate, a tiny kiss of the hops, notes of pumpkin (that sounds weird, doesn't it?). Light-medium bodied, carbonation doesn't get in the way, easy drinking...I approve. I expected a reasonable, easy drinking beer from Tree Brewing, but what I got was a more FLAVORFUL, easy drinking beer. I also forgot how good a malty beer can be. This is my favorite of the three beers I've sampled from Tree.Jul 08, 2010"", 'Coppery brown, with suspended sediment throughout. A thin white head bubbles up, then almost immediately disappeared. After the previous disappointment with Tree\'s Kelowna, I carefully chose a new, perfectly clean and detergent-free glass. It ain\'t the glass at fault here.Aromas are sparse and barely recognizable. After drinking half the pint, I\'m starting to believe I can detect a hint of something malty. There is a suggestion of toastiness, and a vaguely corny sweetness in there somewhere too. The ""malt"" tastes like an old homebrew made with stale DME -- and I\'ve tasted many of those. Again with a bit of corny sweetness. Hops? Technically, I guess they\'re in here.The body and mouthfeel are decent, at least.This is a lame beer, and not worth it: not worth the calories, not worth money, not worth the bladder space that could be used by something tastier. First the Kelowna, and now this. What is going on, Tree? Seriously.Jun 14, 2010', 'Part of CanBIF6 from wordemupg, thanks! I could see right away this one was not a good candidate for quality head production so I poured really hard. Only half a finger of light-beige head resulted, and even that quickly receded to whips across the surface and a ring around the glass. The body is translucent and dark-amber in colour. Nice colour, I suppose.The smell off the head is mostly biscuity malt. After the head disappears it\'s hard to pull much off this one: toasty malt, sweet pineapple, corn. Some butter and caramel come out as it warms. Nothing special. I have to admit I\'m pretty disappointed here. I was expecting at least something decent from Tree; this is average at best. Light, watery malt meets up with only a trace of hops. There\'s a slight peppery aspect, mostly showing itself on the finish. Everything is so light. On a scale of 10, if this beer is a 1 in terms of intensity I feel like Tree could turn it up to 8 or 9 and maybe it would be worth drinking. No obvious flaws, just much too boring and watery. It is medium bodied as stated on the can. The carbonation is too effervescent for this light brew. I\'m not generally a fan of amber ale and this example isn\'t about to convert me. Why does amber ale always taste like this? Maybe I just don\'t appreciate the style. Every amber I\'ve tried has been completely uninteresting and this one is no exception. Sure, it\'s drinkable and would totally be sessionable if your thing is flavourless amber ale. The can boasts that Thirsty Beaver is, ""bursting with flavour"". I guess this can burst all of its flavour somewhere else, none of it ended up in my mouth. demcorhip, I agree with you: uninspired sums this one up.Jun 04, 2010', ""A nice enough looking amber ale. Decent enough head, but not much for retention. Thanks to Stagger for CanBif'ing this my way.A nice enough malt nose, some toasted biscuit with hints of butter and toffee. Hops are grassy and a little floral and somewhat boring, certainly not able to compete for my interest with the Sadies playing background.No surprises on the taste, much like the nose. And also somewhat astringent and husky, a characteristic that was also obvious in their Cutthroat PA. Decent enough, but perhaps a little too safe and uninspired. Or maybe im just jonesing for some green cone action...As an american styled fest beer this is pretty good. As an american amber ale im wondering where the american hops are. A good, solid ale with a nice toasted malt character. Id just like a whack of hops, or a little something to make me say wow...May 31, 2010"", 'Pours a clear copper color with a two finger off white head that has some retention and leaves some lacing.Smell is biscuty malt, bread, toffee and little hops.Tastes toffee, biscuty malt with hints of roasted malt with hoppy, grassy, lemon-like bitterness in the finish.Mouthfeel is creamy with a medium body and lots of carbonationMay 31, 2010', ""This delicious beer came at a sweet price and a free Tree Enviro-bag.

Damned fine form for stereotypically, yet still humorously skewering yer average craft brew fan in the Great White North, I suppose.This beer pours a medium-pale golden amber colour, with three fingers of puffy, and loosely bubbly off-white head, which leaves a few sparse, elongated streaks of sudsy cloud lace around the glass as things sink duly south.It smells of somewhat biscuity, lightly caramelized malt, a hint of acerbic lemon, and further grassy, leafy, and weedy hops. The taste is pretty much a veritably bang-on follow-through: moderately crisp, biscuity, but underwhelmingly caramelized malt, a bit of neutered orange citrus, and plain grassy, kind of woodsy, weedy hops. The carbonation is on the moderately tame side, the body a barely medium weight, and mostly smooth. It finishes well off-dry, the citrus-tinged, rather plain maltiness hanging on with both withered hands.An adequately approachable amber ale, in a rather overcrowded market. I do like the citrus edge, but not enough to make this my go-to, if I even had one for the style.Nov 04, 2009', '0ml can poured into pint glass 0ct9 2009A clear copper with a nice one finger head that has decent retention but leaves little laceS some caramel and mild hops and citrusT as it smells but a little sweeterM nice feel, creamy with good carbonation and a little biteD I liked it, easy to drink and no real problems with this oneI see people buy this beer for no other reason then the name and the happy beaver on the can.

Smells a bit more like a pale ale than an amber; to me it just lacks that creamy edge and slight hop scent I've found in ambers before. Maltier in scent than taste.Taste is a good balance of malt and hops.

The hops are lightly bitter, but do make themselves know right of the bat.

Possible decent session beer.Mar 04, 2006', 'This is a bottle of the ""Thirsty Beaver"" Amber ale. Pours a very orange colour with a thin cap of creamy off-white head. The cap fades even thinner, but doesn\'t seem to be going away.The smell is of caramel, and that\'s really all I can pull out of it at first. With a little more patience I think there is a toasted bread smell in there, something I can\'t remember detecting in a beer before. Interesting, but not amazing.The smell is a trick for this beer, as the taste is dominated by the hoppy finish. There is a mild sweet toffee to begin, but as the beer is swallowed, it fills the back of the mouth with clean hop bitterness. It may even be a bit soapy. The finish lingers, leaving the back end of the tongue tingling.Mouthfeel has a tiny bit of stickyness to it, and a low to medium carbonation. It isn\'t bad, it is what I\'d expect.This beer is fairly drinkable, but I\'d say that many other ambers go down easier.I\'ve had this beer with my wife\'s curry before, and it was perfect.

Toasted malt aroma mixed with a light flowery smell. No strong flavors, just more of what it smells like: toasted malt and caramel, with a touch of flowery sweetness. Clean and well balanced, no aftertaste. Easy to drink. Smooth companion to the hoppy Pale and IPA from Tree.May 28, 2005', ""This beer is now called Thirsty Beaver with a stupid cartoon on the label. AArgh marketing . On to the beer. Mid gold with red overtones this looks nice in a pint glass. The nose is malty which goes with the smooth hit of malt in the first sip. A perfect counterpoint to the very hoppy Hophead. This is food friendly, easy drinking beer with a real deep finish. Along with Lighthouse amber this is BC's best representation of this style.Apr 12, 2005"", 'The Amber Ale pours nicely, with a good 5 or 6 cm of bone-white head. The head is meringue but not nearly long enough, and the lacing is chunky: the bubbles seem reluctant to stick to the glass. The liquid is a mixture of red and orange, perhaps some light brown near the edges. Very translucent. This is an average looking amber ale. The first aroma I smelt was hops, and this quite strong for a typical amber ale. Besides this there are some lightly toasted bread smells, some raisin pudding, caramel and butter, and, all in all, the aroma does not differ much from their All Natural Pale Ale, with the exception of a little more malt, and I do mean little. Definite fresh wood aromas. Taste too is a little woody, which might be expected from a brewery named Tree, with some more strong hops(for the style); the malt seems to be in the background throughout this entire beer. At first the buttery malt is there, but on the middle and finish, the dry and pine-like resins take over, leaving the mouth with only light malt and little body. The toasted malt does leave some saltiness, a little sweetness, and some sourish notes. If they would drop the hopping a tad, and concentrate on thickening the body, this would be quite a decent amber. The mouthfeel is far too thin for the style, and bitterness curbs my desire for many of these at a sitting. As a beer, this is not bad, but for the style, this is disappointing, not to mention overhopped.Feb 05, 2005', 'Picked up a 6 of this in Vancouver. Nice clear coppery colour, good carbonation, bubbley white head on the pour that recedes to a very thin cap, and then to a ring. Caramel malt and faint but sharp hops on the nose. Flavour is predominated by sweet caramel malt, herbal hops on the finish. Mouthfeel is somewhat watery although the carbonation adds a bit of body.

This brew is actually dubbed ""Beachcomber"" Summer Ale and is a cloudy lemon yellow hefeweizen with off-white head. Aroma is typical of well-crafted North American takes on this style, banana and clove with banana dominating, along with some citrus rind and faint brown sugar and perhaps just a tinge of roast. Palate mirrors this closely, a big banana forward flavor with some citrus, clove, and white pepper spice, crisp and refreshing despite the fruitiness. Appropriately fizzy and thin to moderate body with a tangy, crisp finish. Shows some of the hybrid American wheat and hefeweizen character you often get with North American takes on this style but very good nonetheless. Some added noble hops in the finish provide an extra element and sure, this would make a solid summer session option.Apr 27, 2014', 'Great to see this beer back in rotation under another guise as it was my fave Hefe about 2 years ago.

It smells of bready and doughy caramel malt, some vanilla-accented rye whiskey, wet raisins, subtle earthy yeast, and very weak leafy, musty, and floral green hop bitters.

There was a time (early on) in my beer-drinking career where I was a big fan of honey lagers - including staples like Sleeman's Honey Brown and even Lakeport's shoddy substitute. It'll be nice to revisit my roots. Served well-chilled.Pours an attractive, clear amber colour, topped with just over one finger's worth of soapy, off-white froth. It seeps away steadily over the next few minutes, leaving behind a thin film and narrow collar. The aroma is very sweet - honey and red licorice candy come to mind, with notes of caramel and corny cereal grains. For the style, this is well-above average at this point. A decent honey lager, but still a little too sweet for my tastes. Pale malts, corn grits and caramel complement the marked honey sweetness, which remains fairly dominant into the aftertaste. On the lighter side of medium-bodied, with a creamy mouthfeel accented by the moderate carbonation levels. This is a supremely drinkable lager, although due to its sweet nature I don't know if I'd be able to tolerate it all night. Fans of Sleeman's Honey Lager will have little trouble adjusting to this one. Final Grade: 3.59, a B grade. Bear Paw Honey Lager is not a stellar beer, but it's drinkable enough and a fair substitute for any mass-produced red lager - e.g. Rickard's or Keith's Red. This is really more of an amber than an adjunct lager, although technically speaking honey *is* an adjunct, so I'll just snip that tangent in the bud right there. One of the best adjunct lagers I've ever had, anyway. I could see myself drinking this once in a while if it were available in ON, but it would depend on the price point.Aug 12, 2014"", ""A- Pours a clear yet robust golden honey color, and there is a good bit of big bubbly carbonation throughout the liquid. The head is a mixture of bristly large bubbles and smooth dense foam....the head looks really unsettled as it dissipates into a somewhat thick-ish layer. The lacing is interesting....watery yet oily looking, and not a whole lot of foam clings to the glass.S- Very much of honey....this is by far the dominant aroma going on here. Other than this it doesn't offer much else to the nasal cavity....clean grainy smells, modest malt and perhaps some corn/rice. It is a sweet smelling lager, of course due to the honeyed quality but is very reminiscent of a lager aroma wise anyways...T- More of the same happening here, with a very dominant honey flavor....now this isn't a bad thing...Whistler does a very good job of making this the primary character of the beer, there just isn't much else to talk about here. It's cleanly flavored, and the finish does have a modest bitter taste that helps to balance out the palate for the next taste.M- This is quite a smooth creamy lager if I do say so! The carbonation is deceiving by looks, as it the bubbles aren't zesty at all on the palate, but provide a complimentary burst of honey flavor. The body isn't full by any means but definitely leans towards medium. Overall this category doesn't disappoint!O- Overall this is a very decent honey lager that delivers on the primary flavor that they were going for, and I've tried several similar type of beers that don't go as far as this one does. I would buy this again, and think this makes an excellent dessert brew and would do well with a spicy Asian dish to help balance things out.Jun 18, 2013"", ""Whistler has been making a big splash in Alberta with its great looking packaging and fantastic tasting beers. This is among the most popular ones.It's not everyday that I see an adjunct lager and say that it's well made, but this is such a case. It pours a brilliant brown colour with a relatively quickly dissipating head. There's a good hit of honey in the aroma, as well as malt and a little corn.The taste is really pleasant - you notice the honey in the beer very suddenly and you experience a little bit of corny aftertaste, but it's not really unpleasant at all. However, it is really one dimensional, as all I can make out is sweetness from this beer. That's not to say it's bad, but it isn't very exciting either. The feel is smooth and you have a nice hit of carbonation in your throat. To the average beer drinker, they likely won't notice the adjunct taste. More experienced drinkers will likely pick it up. However, unless you're so adamantly against drinking anything with adjuncts in it, you likely won't be put off by it. Not bad, but but not very outstanding. Still, it is tasty enough for me to recommend it.Jun 16, 2013"", ""This beer pours a clear golden brown with a moderate head that dissipates quite quickly. You can pick up the scent of honey, and other than that, it smells like, well, lager. I taste mainly the honey, but it's not overly sweet. A bit malty. Medium bodied, not overly carbonated. This is a very pleasant, easy drinking beer that I can easily see becoming a summer favourite.May 19, 2013"", 'An enjoyable honey lager with a nice copper colour. An easy sipper and enjoyable on a nice summer day. Very subtle hints of honey but blends in well. Enoyable but not overly exciting. The price is right for the quality and is a good representation of the type.May 26, 2012', 'Appearance- Pours a clear light copper colour with a finger width of foamy head. Moderate bubbles are present.Smell- Sweet aromas of honey, caramel, and a hint of orange zest.Taste- Mild sweetness of the honey comes through along with malts. Slight hint of brown rice.Mouthfeel- Light to medium bodied with a light carbonation. A surprising silky smoothness. Overall- An easy drinking lager by Whistler. Very mild flavours but the sweet honey taste and smooth texture makes this quite enjoyable. I see this as a summer refresher. Could use a little work around the edges but still worth a try.Feb 17, 2012', ""0ml bottle. I don't see how this isn't just the normal honey lager all gussied up in mountain lore imagery, but, with apologies to David Coverdale, here I go again.This beer pours a clear, bright medium copper amber hue, with two pudgy fingers of puffy, thinly foamy, and fizzy off-white head, which disappears slowly and surely before my eyes, leaving some weird Simpson-esque amoebic lace around the glass. It smells of sweet bready pale malt, a touch of corny grain, and mildly mollifying bland and musty honey, with not a lot going on hop-wise. The taste is bready, of the generally corn-oriented sort, much-lessened earthy honey, a mild dose of weedy, somewhat herbal hops, and a niggling sour tang that does its best Princess and the Pea number on me. The carbonation is rather sedate, just a wan frothiness throughout, the body medium-light in weight, and arguably smooth, though a slight cloying tingle becomes increasingly hard to ignore. It finishes off-dry, the aforementioned graininess and plain as the day is long honey still running this particular sideshow.Nothing renamed, nothing gained, I suppose. Another average, run of the mill honey beer - the Canadian beer-scape is littered with such middling fare. Good for only when an apres-ski hook-up invariably depends upon its, erm, 'lubricating' presence. And for that, I salute it.Dec 25, 2011"", ""A - crystal clear rich copper, finger of head dissipated to a few random islandsS - clear adjunct aroma, mild sweetness with faint hop aromasT - sugary sweet syrup flavour dominates and tastes fairly artificial, some light molasses maltiness with corn like adjunctM - medium body with an initial sticky sweet feel, drys out nicely leaving some honey sweetness on the teethO - its a good enough honey brew but nothing that makes it stand out from the crowd, I wouldn't turn it down at the pub but it wouldn't be my first choiceSep 10, 2011""]",/beer/profile/14349/73026/

Also note; there is a thin white lacing on top.S: Has a distinct Vegemite aroma, perhaps a means to get Aussie ex-pats into it. This aside there are notes of burnt caramel, rye, earthy hops and yeast. Not really pale ale stuff again, more like an English dark ale or a brown ale.T: Amazingly bland compared to the aroma. Tastes like a soda-stream soft drink before you mix the flavour with the soda water, then it hits you with an additive flavour of burnt caramel, rye, earthy hops and yeast. Finishes as boring as it began with a tapered hop bitterness and a long dry taste. Not impressed by this at all.M: Light bodied, watery with a hyperactive carbonation taking into consideration the last two items.D: I hope you can see where I'm going with this review, a pale ale that isn't a pale ale, tastes like an awful soft drink, gassy and most importantly: lacking in coherent flavour. This beer is one reason not to go to Whistler, though my guess is that the Export Rule applies with this brew [the Export Rule being that countries always export their shitest beers , QED: Fosters for Australia] so I imagine their are some really good brews hiding over there.

It finishes off-dry, the consistent malt pushed a bit more by some peppy grassy hops.A good example of a more hoppy English pale ale, even if those hops seem haphazard and muddled.

Well, maybe, but given the fact that my two buddies' pints of other beers both had nice heads (that lasted), it was not a good first impression. Literally no aroma aside from basic biscuit, but this was likely compounded by the lack of head. The taste was only modestly better, with only an additional hint of nuttiness to speak of.

Googling Whistler Brewing resulted in the prior information, plus the intersting tidbit that although the claim on the bottle of being brewed exclusively with Whistler glacier water is true, the beer itself is brewed in Kamloops (that\x92s about a six hour drive). This means that Dean and his associates are still using the facilities that Big Rock used for WBC before shutting down production, although a Whistler based brewery is in the works.This beer pours like a pale ale should: a nice light copper with a thick, white head.

It reminded me a bit of ""Eidelweiss"", except that I like that beer a whole lot more than this one, so that was another hurdle to overcome.I can\'t really complain about the taste, although the closer to the bottom of the glass you get, the more sediment you pick up and that makes the flavors inconsistent from first to last sips.Jul 09, 2008']",/beer/profile/14349/43154/

It finishes off-dry, the caramel malt holding fast, while the weak citrus and still good to go green hoppiness bristle.Overall, this comes across as a very engaging and easy to drink pale ale, something to sit around and enjoy, while talking about something else, even your bloody canine pets, if need be.

It is a pale ale not just stylistically but literally also - dandelion yellow in colour, it does have a filminess of sorts but it's not quite dense enough to obstruct transparency. Honeyed highlights bounce out of the glass at certain angles. Chase My Tail doesn't get me excited enough to jump out my chair and run in circles, but the aroma is assuring of good - I'm not expecting great - things to come. At most mildly hoppy, it sure doesn't smell like a West Coast-style pale ale and exhibits the doughy-sweet maltiness of more mainstream brands. And there's nothing wrong with malty pale ales (especially when they're laced with a small amount of fruity hoppiness). Flavour is desirable regardless of which ingredient it comes from - toasty, very lightly caramelized barely is no more, no less tasty than pine resins and tropical fruit peels....though it helps this has a bit of both. The grain definitely predominates on the palate; the hops only show up after the fact, making a brief but noticeably earthy aftertaste. It's not strong enough to turn anyway away but it certainly distinguishes this from bland, insipid mass-market pale ales. If you're one who enjoys simple, easy-going beers but still prefer they have flavour and personality, this Yellow Dog offering may very well become your best friend. It provides universal approachability and unimpeded drinkability for those with higher standards.

The taste is some rather edgy piney and leafy green hoppiness up front, crackery and grainy pale malt, a lessened caramel sweetness, still hard to ignore stone paths after the recent cold-ass autumn rain, more focused citrus rind fruitiness, and some not so subtle metallic booziness.The bubbles are adequate for the job at hand, via their sturdy frothiness, the body a so-so middleweight, and smooth by the same skewed metric - y'know, good if you only care about the hops, and not so much if you're expecting more.

Medium weight, fluffs up nicely, has a big bitter bite but remains drinkable, finishes like you’re chewing on a pine needle. Top notch IPA at every point, I couldn’t help myself and had several pints.

Juicy peaches in the flavor and full luscious fruit.Mar 20, 2016', 'Can: Poured an amber color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of citrusy hops with some bitter notes. Taste is a mix between fresh green citrusy notes and a fair bit of bitterness with light biscuit malt notes. Body is about average with good carbonation. Enjoyable but more bitterness then I usually liked in my IPAs.Feb 12, 2016', 'Very nice nose, bright citrus fruits jump out, a bit of tropical as well. Seems to be a caramel note. Flavour is also good, but a slight step down. Orange, pine and a substantial caramel backing. Fairly bitter finish. Quite a nice IPA.Feb 07, 2016', 'Got on trade! Served at 4deg C in a draught glass. 473ml can.A- Opens well and pours a 1"" high white head that is gone in a minute but it has this wonderful golden orange hue to it that is just fantastic. Filtered but not clear. S- Good hops here. Orange, coriander and a wonderful malt baseT- Grapefruit and citrus notes galore. Super tasty. Has a plump with acid feel from the hops which I do like if it\'s done right and this one is done right. The blend as a bitter note at the end that with the choice of powerhouse hops used is expected. Very nice blendM- Tart to say the least. Has a bite to it that is a bit interesting as it moves from tangy to bitter.O- Very likable brew. I do enjoy the plump fruitiness of the blend. I think I would take this one over 95% of the IPA\'s out there. I wish distribution nationally was available but unfortunately it is not. If I were to travel to BC first thing I would do would be to buy case of these beauties!Food PairingThis wonderful little brew went very well with.......... Believe it or not..... Pickled fish! Nice herring in a vinegar and onion brine. I like this contrast and it is a ""Here comes a POW!"" contrast as the mouth explodes in saliva and flavor such a treatEnjoy!Nov 14, 2015', ""Play Dead looks very much alive - fiery amber highlights radiate from its otherwise deep complexion and bubbles flutter continuously. Even its foam has a life of its own - constantly regenerating itself and able to ascend up the glass even as the liquid beneath it depletes. It's a very solid looking IPA. Hops are in no short supply here. The aroma is wholly enveloped in scents of leafy greens and overripe fruits (we're talking a summer's crop worth of cantaloupe and just about any variety of citrus that comes to mind). It's a plump, concentrated, undiluted showcase of hops at their finest and most stinging. Although fairly stock by the smell of things, Play Dead is a somewhat distinctive IPA in taste; it's not just the customary pine or citrus flavours. No, this also has slightly offbeat notes of sauteed greens (think spinach) and a manifestly herbal quality that carries long into the finish like bitter medicine. The 6.8% alcohol is a little noticeable too. The 75 IBU not so much. I anticipated from both the appearance and aroma a much greater presence of malt; there is a trace of caramel but there's certainly no crunch. I've got to assume the recipe allocated for a little more toasty toffee flavour than this; more of those dark honey notes would accentuate the forest-y resins. If you ask me, IPAs are a man's best friends - for most craft beer drinkers hops elicit a kind of Pavlov's dogs effect. Though not over-the-top hoppy, Play Dead makes great companionship for those that prefer a more balanced example of the style for everyday drinking. It was a treat.Sep 16, 2015"", 'Poured from the can into a tulipA- Pours gold, with slowly receding white head.S- Normal IPA bouquet of citrus and pine, with hints of some mango or apricot when it warms.T- Does a girl know how an IPA is supposed to taste? Tropical fruit is the outstanding element of this brew.M- Creamy, smooth, medium carb. Absolutely poundable.O- One of the best IPAs available in BC on the regular.

Poured from a 473 ml can. A: Crystal-clear amber/copper with off-white headS: tropical fruit - mango, melon, maybe canned peaches too. Not as much citrus as most of the IPAs I've had.T: Lots of fruit flavour, bitterness maybe not as pronounced?F: Medium body or a little less.May 13, 2015"", 'Running a flight at the brewery. This poured a nice copper with a thin white head. The nose has some malt and citrus hop and a lot of tropical fruit. The hops comes more to the front on the palate with some bready malts and pineapple and kiwi. Again there is quite a bit of tropical fruit. The hop bitterness is pretty strong but still the beer is fairly well balanced. Very enjoyable. My favorite of the evening.Feb 09, 2015', 'Look: Slightly hazy amber-yellow, half a finger of fluffy head.Smell: This thing is juicy. Lots of tropical sweetness, biscuity malt, nice. Taste: Bitter grapefruit, tropical fruit (especially mango), excellent malt balance. Has a real sharp fruity brightness that really makes this stand out above almost all other local IPAs.Feel: Nice carbonation, absurdly drinkable. Easy to have too many of these and ""play dead"" yourself.I still find that there\'s a bit of batch variation, but at its best, this is the #1 IPA in BC. At its worst, it is still a very solid local offering that I\'ll order/buy more often than not. Can\'t wait for them to start canning, it will be my summer of 2015 beer in that format.Feb 05, 2015', 'Fresh boston round picked up about an hour ago.Appearance. Pours a lovely rich amber-gold with just a touch of haze. One finger of white head with moderate retention, fading to a collar and light skim. Smell. Mango, juicy peaches, papaya, yellow grapefruit and lemon zest, some lightly spicy and grainy caramel malts and maybe a faint touch of cedar. Taste. Tropical fruit, but not as juicy as the smell. Light grainy caramel malts, some grapefruit rind bitterness but not palate fatiguing like many ipas. Mouthfeel. Medium body, just below medium amount of fairly creamy carbonation. Overall. Another great offering from my local brewery. Really love saying that, my local brewery.Aug 15, 2014', ""Original review was just 3.75... good, but not among the best.
