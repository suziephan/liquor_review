       "51   Czechvar pours a crystal clear golden colour. A light carbonation is evident as a few small bubbles rise to the surface after pouring. A delicate hop aroma creates the first sensation on the taste buds. Next an early hop bitterness comes through followed closely by a dry pale malty flavour that is mellowed by the soft mouth feel. This medium-bodied lager reveals an overall character that is clean and dry and that finishes slightly crisp. Overall a beer flavourful enough for a winter thirst reprieve but light enough to quench that heat-induced summer urge for a cold one.   \n",
