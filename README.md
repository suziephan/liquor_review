# Beer Recommendation

# Project Summary
Beers go great with food. Beers may benefit your health. There are many reasons why you should have some beer once in a while, but if you are not a beer drinker, you might be overwhelm about the number of beers out there. As non-drinkers ourselves, we understand the struggle of going inside a liquor store, standing in front of a shelf, and spending minutes just to figure our what to buy. This project was built to help people with the same problem. We scraped the reviews from a beer review website of every beer product in BC Liquor Store, and recategorized all products based on taste and aroma. We recategorized this way because non-drinkers mostly care about these attributes. Since they do not know much about beer styles, it is not reasonable to categorize products into styles such as Ale, Lager, Wheat, etc.
