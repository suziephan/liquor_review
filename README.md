# liquor_review
A project to build recommendation liquor for all people  
Introduction:
I dont drink beer too often, but all my friend and my family loves beer, that 's why I always buy beer as a gift for them. 
Sometimes, I enjoy few sip too, but it is really difficult for me to choose the beer I like as all the website they categorized style and type of beer very confused and use technical words
Therefore, I want to build a website with easier word , target to all customer ( those who are new and those who are expert to beer) so that they can make decision easier
